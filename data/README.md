## Data Backups

**Do not use this repository to download or display COVID Tracking Project data**. Use the [COVID Tracking API](https://covidtracking.com/api) instead.

---

This folder contains CSV and JSON data backups from the [Covid Tracking API](https://covidtracking.com/api) as well as archived government data files from the CDC and HHS. 

These are the sources for the federal data in this folder (note that they are not direct download links, they're meant to give context instead):

### HHS

- COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/6xf2-c3ie
- COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries: https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh
- COVID-19 Diagnostic Laboratory Testing (PCR Testing) Time Series: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Diagnostic-Laboratory-Testing-PCR-Testing/j8mb-icvb
- COVID-19 Estimated Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Estimated-ICU-Beds-Occupied-by-State-Time/7ctx-gtb7 (3 files)
- COVID-19 Community Profile Report - County-Level: https://www.healthdata.gov/Community/COVID-19-Community-Profile-Report-County-Level/di4u-7yu6 

Note that these files are saved as they are released, with the filename being generated by HHS (not by us) - it generally reflects the time of release. 
Due to a change in how the data is published, starting April 2, 2021, the timestamp in the filename is generated by us and reflects the date of 
release in the Eastern timezone. The datasets remain the same after this transition.

These files are all backed up to the [HHS subdirectory here](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/tree/master/data/hhs).

### CDC

The following files are stored under the same file in this repo, so to see changes, you will need to view the git history:
- COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State Over Time: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36, saved to [cdc_cases_deaths.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_cases_deaths.csv)
- COVID-19 County-level data: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view, saved to [cdc_counties.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_counties.csv)
- Vaccination data: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations, saved to [cdc_vaccines.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccines.json)
- Vaccination data in a more convenient CSV time series format, processed by the script in `/data-collection-scripts/cdc_vaccination_timeseries.py` and saved to [cdc_vaccines_timeseries.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccines_timeseries.csv). 
We also process this data into [cdc_vaccines_timeseries_daily.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccines_timeseries_daily.csv), where multiple updates from the same date are reduced to the most recent data only.
- CDC vaccination trends data for US and LTC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends, saved to [cdc_vaccination_trends.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccination_trends.json)
- CDC vaccination demographics data: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographic, saved to [cdc_vaccinations_demographics.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccinations_demographics.json)
- US COVID-19 Cases Caused by Variants: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html, saved to [cdc_variants.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_variant_cases.csv). 
  Older CDC data about the B.1.1.7 variant only is archived in [cdc_b117_cases.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_b117_cases.json). 
  Additional older CDC data  about variants is archived in [cdc_variants.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_variant_cases.json). 
- Long-term Care Facility Vaccination data: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations-ltc, saved to [cdc_vaccinations_ltc.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccinations_ltc.json). 
  This data is also available processed into a CSV time series format in [cdc_vaccines_ltc_timeseries.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccines_ltc_timeseries.csv) 
  and [cdc_vaccines_ltc_timeseries_daily.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/cdc_vaccines_ltc_timeseries_daily.csv)
- CDC testing data, saved to [cdc_testing.json](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/commits/master/data/cdc_testing.json)
- CDC Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts, saved to [cdc_provisional_deaths.csv](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/commits/master/data/cdc_provisional_deaths.csv)

We have saved, but are no longer updating, older CDC case, testing and deaths data. To see how these files had changed in the past, see the GitHub history as follows:

### LTC
Long-term care data scraped from state dashboards, in the [ltc_states](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/ltc_states) directory
