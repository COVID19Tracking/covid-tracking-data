AK,"Alaska combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

Alaska reports a ""Total count"" of people who have been hospitalized, but we do not record that count in our **Ever hospitalized** metric, since it does not include people who are currently in the hospital.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On November 7, 2020, Alaska announced that their testing dashboard would be ""temporarily disabled from November 6th to November 9th"" and that testing data could be accessed through their [data summary tables] (https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com). After originally using the data summary tables on November 7th, we have reversed that decision, and reverted the values to their November 6th state. The frozen values were replaced on November 10, with values from the state's [Tests Dataset](https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tests-dataset). 

On November 6, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) and Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (specimens), decreased as well.

On November 5, 2020, Alaska’s Total PCR tests (specimens) increased from roughly 628k to 782k. We were unable to find an explanation for the increase.

As of September 18, 2020, Alaska's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On November 10, 2020 Alabama’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 700 without explanation.

On October 21, 2020, Alabama did not update their COVID-19 dashboard due to ""technical issues"".

As of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.

On July 15, 2020, we changed our data reporting to reflect that Alabama reports test totals in specimens rather than unique people tested, as we had initially believed. All test results were moved into the correct API field and metric.

On July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result.

AR,"During the week of September 20, 2020, Arkansas made some continual adjustments to its antigen people tested numbers, resulting in some fluctuation in its negatives and totals.

As of September 18, 2020, Arkansas's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The totals do not include repeat positives—counting individuals only for their first positive—but do count repeat negative tests.

On September 16, 2020, Arkansas’s **Negative Tests (PCR)** dropped by 26,801 tests, causing its **Total Tests (PCR)** to drop by 26,195 tests due to the reversal of a data dump of negative test results that Arkansas reversed. It also added 140 probable deaths, not all of which dated to September 16.

On September 3, 2020, Arkansas began reporting probable cases according to the most recent CSTE definitions, in addition to confirmed cases. This added 423 new cases to AR’s **Total cases** number.

On Aug 15, 2020, Arkansas data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases from its dataset.

AZ,"Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard

Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On October 6, 2020, The Arizona Department of Health Services [announced](https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=AZDHS&utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&utm_content=3840149936&linkId=101333440) that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.

As of September 25, 2020, Arizona’s total test timeseries is stored in our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of Total PCR Tests (specimens), reflecting a response to our outreach to Arizona’s health department that it counts unique individuals tested. Arizona includes antigen tests in its totals figure, so if an individual received both an antigen and PCR test, they are counted only once. Additionally, as of September 25, 2020,  Arizona's total test results are drawn from our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed. 

On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.

From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for **cases** and **deaths**. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.

On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for **Cumulative hospitalized** to match Arizona's dashboard data for ""hospitalized by date admitted."" Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance.

From July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.

From June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily **case** numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.

On July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.

As of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

On April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged **negative test** data. 

Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s).

We report Colorado data a day after posting due to timing, so this note applies to the data published on July 28.

On June 14, 2020, Colorado revised previous ""daily discharged"" numbers. This caused an overall decline in their **Recovered** data.

On July 1, 2020, we revised our historical data to reflect the death-certificate metric instead of the deaths-among-cases metric. Because of this change in methodology, there is a drop from 1,091 deaths on May 15 to 878 on May 16 in our data.

FL,"Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/).

[Per reporting](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html), the number of **pending tests** (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.

On November 3, 2020, Florida’s **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** dropped by over 200 with no explanation.

On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer. 

On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our `totalTestEncountersViral` field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the `T_NegRes` and `C_AllResTypes` values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in `totalTestsPeopleViral`. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.

On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as **Total PCR Tests (People)** did not update.

As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our **Probable cases** field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.

On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to ""an unforeseen technical issue"" that was ""not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health."" The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.

On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.

On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** (_positiveCasesViral_ in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (_positive_ in our API) will be unaffected.

On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: ""The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.""

As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a ""primary diagnosis of COVID-19.""

Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.

Kansas reports much of its data on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only, so there are often large changes in the values, which can represent 2-3 days of data.

The **Recovered** data point we report for Kansas reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized. Kansas notes that this metric only includes cases with available discharge information reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

On October 21, 2020, the **inIcuCurrently** value for KS dropped from 81 to 1 on the state's dashboard. We recorded it, but expect it to be revised at another point. 

On July 15, 2020, Kansas began reporting additional data from hospitals, and at that time, data for the **Now hospitalized** metric was only available through July 10.

This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected. 

On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** before August 12, 2020 based on the state's ""Tests by Date"" dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.

On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting **probable cases** weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19.

Michigan combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. 

On October 29, 2020, Michigan experienced connectivity issues resulting in some cases that would have been reported tomorrow to be reported today. This is due to the fact that the state has a strict 10AM cutoff for daily data reporting. This means the daily increase in cases encompasses more than one day's worth of data.

On October 15, 2020, Michigan announced that due to a laboratory result processing slowdown, several cases that would normally have been included in the October 14, 2020 update were reported on October 15, 2020. The issue has since been resolved. Aa a result, cases reported on October 15, 2020 may not have been reported within the last 24 hour period.

According to the [state dashboard annotation](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases), the ""Hospitalized with COVID"" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are ""Hospitalized due to COVID"". We are using the ""Hospitalized with COVID"" figure for our **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the ""Due to COVID"" Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.

On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases.

We carried forward the last reported number of people tested negative between October 15 and October 21 (our policy when a metric goes missing without notice is to “freeze” the number for up to seven days to allow states to recover from temporary reporting problems). Since our API uses the sum of positive+negative tests to calculate the total number of tests in Nevada, this caused the number of total tests on those dates to increase only by the number of positives.

On August 2, 2020, Texas noted that ""New data will not be posted on this dashboard on Sunday, August 2 due to a scheduled upgrade to the system that processes electronic lab reports. Data for Sunday will be posted with Monday’s data update.""

On July 30, 2020, Texas noted that ""Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27–29. As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.""

On July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly ""new"" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.

On July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas app

Starting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.

On July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas. We are currently reviewing historical data to maintain an accurate time-series.

VA,"**Ever hospitalized** is calculated from the ""currently hospitalized"" and ""discharged"" data points on the Virginia Hospital COVID-19 dashboard. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Virginia reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** in the absence of better data.

As of September 18, 2020, Virginia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 31, 2020 we began publishing **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** for Virginia. This data has been collected daily since July 21, 2020. Previous data going back to February 27, 2020 was taken from state historical data as of July 21. Historical data for **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** before July 21, 2020 was updated based on the same dataset, extending the column back to February 27, 2020 as well.

On August 27, the VA dashboard did not update by our publish time. We are carrying over the values from August 26

On **November 3, 2020**, Vermont’s **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased without explanation. As a result, Vermont’s negative test results, which are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased as well.

On October 29, 2020, Vermont started publishing **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **Total PCR Tests (in people)**. We backfilled the full time series for this metric from Vermont's Arcgis layer.

WA,"Washington State reports **confirmed cases**, **laboratory tests**, and **deaths** as of the previous day. 

We report the most recent hospitalization data available for Washington. In some cases, this data may be reviewed and revised by the Washington State Department of Health. As a result, Washington considers hospitalization data complete after a 18-day lag period. In our data this lag is 20 days.

As of September 18, 2020, Washington's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.

On August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that ""DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.""

On July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.

On June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On April 18, 2020, Washington state removed 190 **confirmed cases** that were discovered to be out-of-state residents tested in Washington laboratories.

WI,"On October 29, we populated the full time series for Total Test Encounters (PCR) from a time series provided by Wisconsin via CSV on their dashboard. Also as of October 29, Wisconsin's `totalTestResults` represent total test encounters instead of being calculated via pos+neg. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the API in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field.

On October 20, Wisconsin started providing a total tests number on their dashboard and we started to collect that data into Total Test Encounters (PCR).

In early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting probable deaths from COVID-19 separately from confirmed deaths from COVID-19. We did not discover this data until June 29, 2020, and so our time series only has data for this metric beginning on that date.

In early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting probable cases of COVID-19 separately from confirmed cases of COVID-19. On June 25, 2020, The COVID Tracking Project added more than two weeks' worth of probable cases to our **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** for WI, initially causing a large single day increase in cases. We subsequently updated our historical Cases data using data provided to us by the state, which eliminated this one-day increase.

WV,"West Virginia reports new antibody tests daily. We sum these numbers in a running total to report a value for the total number of antibody tests West Virginia has conducted. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On July 4, 2020, West Virginia began making continual changes to its previous data for antibody testing, so its historical time series might not match COVID Tracking Project data.

On May 23, 2020, West Virginia began reporting PCR and antibody tests separately. Total test values before this date might include both PCR and antibody tests.

On April 16, 2020, West Virginia began reporting **current hospitalization, ICU, and ventilator** metrics from 49 of 55 counties.

WY,"Wyoming reports both **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** as percentages of **Total tests PCR**. We convert these percentages to integers. Wyoming reports the number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 in each hospital: we sum these values for the state total. Wyoming reports the number of people ever hospitalized with COVID-19 as a percentage: we convert this percentage to an integer. Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.

On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report **Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.
