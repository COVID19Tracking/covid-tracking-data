AL,"Alabama combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

On July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by 3,616 from 3,129 to 6,745 as a result. 

On July 15, 2020, we changed our data reporting to reflect that Alabama reports test totals in specimens rather than unique people tested, as we had initially believed. All test results were moved into the correct API field and metric.

On September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, 54,076 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by 26,943 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.

CA,"Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in **cases** and **deaths**, as the state's data lags behind the county sources.

On April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged **negative test** data. 

As of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

On July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.

From June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily **case** numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.

From July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.

CO,"On May 15, Colorado started reporting deaths for which COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On July 1, 2020, we revised our historical data to reflect the death-certificate metric instead of the deaths-among-cases metric. Because of this change in methodology, there is a drop from 1,091 deaths on May 15 to 878 on May 16 in our data. Colorado also reports subsets of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths, but these metrics correspond to the deaths-among-cases metric we no longer report, so we do not compile this data.

On June 14, 2020, Colorado revised previous ""daily discharged"" numbers. This caused an overall decline in their **Recovered** data.

On July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas. We are currently reviewing historical data to maintain an accurate time-series. 

On July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas appeared smaller than it was. The actual number of new cases in Texas that day was 8,112, not 6,020. 

On July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly ""new"" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.

Starting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.

On July 30, 2020, Texas noted that ""Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27–29. As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.""

On August 2, 2020, Texas noted that ""New data will not be posted on this dashboard on Sunday, August 2 due to a scheduled upgrade to the system that processes electronic lab reports. Data for Sunday will be posted with Monday’s data update.""

As of August 16, 2020, several commercial laboratories submitted previously backlogged test results to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

On June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.

On July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that ""DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.""

On August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.

Washington State reports **confirmed cases**, **laboratory tests**, and **deaths** as of the previous day. 

We report the most recent hospitalization data available for Washington. In some cases, this data may be reviewed and revised by the Washington State Department of Health. As a result, Washington considers hospitalization data complete after a 18-day lag period. In our data this lag is 20 days.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.",https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYmIyYTE0YWYtZDMyOS00YjAzLTgxZTItZDIyMmNlYTZmMWVkIiwidCI6IjhhMjZjZjAyLTQzNGEtNDMxZS04Y2FkLTdlYWVmOTdlZjQ4NCJ9&pageName=ReportSection3aff85597cada99d298f&pageName=ReportSection9f5bc3be6e9ebda92968,https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYmIyYTE0YWYtZDMyOS00YjAzLTgxZTItZDIyMmNlYTZmMWVkIiwidCI6IjhhMjZjZjAyLTQzNGEtNDMxZS04Y2FkLTdlYWVmOTdlZjQ4NCJ9&pageName=ReportSection4bb4fbc7d2bc2ad57511,@WV_DHHR,https://dhhr.wv.gov/Coronavirus%20Disease-COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx,Specimens,posNeg,West Virginia,54,,false
WY,"During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.

During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.

On April 22, 2020, Wyoming revised its **Total PCR tests (specimens)** downward, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the calculated value of **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**. 

On April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.

On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting the **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report *Total PCR tests (people).** We have carried over the previous day's value.

Wyoming reports both **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** as percentages of **Total tests PCR**. We convert these percentages to integers. Wyoming reports the number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 in each hospital: we sum these values for the state total. Wyoming reports the number of people ever hospitalized with COVID-19 as a percentage: we convert this percentage to an integer. Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.
