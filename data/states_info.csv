AL,"Alabama combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.


On July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result. 

On July 15, 2020, we changed our data reporting to reflect that Alabama reports test totals in specimens rather than unique people tested, as we had initially believed. All test results were moved into the correct API field and metric.

On September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.

As of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

AR,"On Aug 15, 2020, Arkansas data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases from its dataset. These changes resulted in reductions in **Total cases**, **Ever hospitalized**, and **Ever in ICU** data.

On September 3, 2020, Arkansas began reporting probable cases according to the most recent CSTE definitions, in addition to confirmed cases. This added 423 new cases to AR’s **Total cases** number.

On September 16, 2020, Arkansas’s **Negative Tests (PCR)** dropped by 26,801 tests, causing its **Total Tests (PCR)** to drop by 26,195 tests due to the reversal of a data dump of negative test results that Arkansas reversed. It also added 140 probable deaths, not all of which dated to September 16.

As of September 18, 2020, Arkansas's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The totals do not include repeat positives—counting individuals only for their first positive—but do count repeat negative tests.

On October 7, 2020, Arkansas's data dashboard did not update by our publication time, so we obtained several data points from a graphic on the home page of the Arkansas Department of Health.

AZ,"Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard

On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for **Cumulative hospitalized** to match Arizona's dashboard data for ""hospitalized by date admitted."" Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.

From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for **cases** and **deaths**. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.

On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.

On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed

As of September 25, 2020, Arizona’s total test timeseries is stored in our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of Total PCR Tests (specimens), reflecting a response to our outreach to Arizona’s health department that it counts unique individuals tested. Arizona includes antigen tests in its totals figure, so if an individual received both an antigen and PCR test, they are counted only once. Additionally, as of September 25, 2020,  Arizona's total test results are drawn from our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On October 6, 2020, The Arizona Department of Health Services [announced](https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=AZDHS&utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&utm_content=3840149936&linkId=101333440) that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.

Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Positive PCR tests (people)** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

CA,"Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in **cases** and **deaths**, as the state's data lags behind the county sources.

On April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged **negative test** data. 

As of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

On July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.

From June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily **case** numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.

From July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.

CO,"On May 15, Colorado started reporting deaths for which COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On July 1, 2020, we revised our historical data to reflect the death-certificate metric instead of the deaths-among-cases metric. Because of this change in methodology, there is a drop from 1,091 deaths on May 15 to 878 on May 16 in our data. Colorado also reports subsets of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths, but these metrics correspond to the deaths-among-cases metric we no longer report, so we do not compile this data.

On June 14, 2020, Colorado revised previous ""daily discharged"" numbers. This caused an overall decline in their **Recovered** data.

On July 27, 2020, Colorado posted a notice that, ""Due to a server issue yesterday and today with our electronic laboratory reporting system, the number of tests completed and cases reported today, July 27, 2020, may be artificially low."" We report Colorado data a day after posting due to timing, so this note applies to the data published on July 28.

FL,"Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/).

On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric. 

Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.

As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a ""primary diagnosis of COVID-19.""

On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: ""The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.""

On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)** (_positiveCasesViral_ in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (_positive_ in our API) will be unaffected.

On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.

On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to ""an unforeseen technical issue"" that was ""not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.""

On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of **cumulative hospitalizations** and **confirmed and probable deaths** ""due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.""

On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that ""Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test."" We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.

On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting **probable cases** weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.

SC,"As of June 11, 2020, South Carolina reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests. Total test numbers were reduced by around 22,000 as a result of this change. 

On July 18, 2020, South Carolina announced it was transitioning to new reporting systems and that ""there may be incomplete data with significant gaps."" Though reporting resumed July 28, 2020, this resulted in data being carried over at times. We will backfill with the updated numbers when they are available.

On August 14, 2020, South Carolina reported an unusually large number of tests without explanation. 

On August 23, 2020, South Carolina [corrected](https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/south-carolina-announces-latest-covid-19-update-august-23-2020) a double-counting of testing numbers from the months May–August. This resulted in a significant drop of all aspects of testing-related counts, with **Total PCR tests (specimens)** dropping by approximately 22,000 and total antibody tests dropping by 1,500.

On September 10, 2020, South Carolina [announced](https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/south-carolina-announces-latest-covid-19-update-september-10-2020) that it added a large number of saliva tests from the University of South Carolina to its data, causing an unusually large number of cases in the data for September 11.  

Between August 25 and September 21, 2020, South Carolina did not provide updated estimates of the number of **Recovered** cases.

On September 15, 2020, South Carolina started reporting antigen testing data, reporting 7,763 positive tests and 23,477 total tests. Its “viral (i.e. molecular/PCR) tests” positives and totals dropped by about the same amount, likely due to the removal of this data.

TX,"As of May 23, 2020, Texas reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests.

On June 16, 2020, Texas notes that ""The reported cases for June 16 include 2,622 new cases and 1,476 cases that were previously diagnosed among Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates but that had not been reported by local health departments (887 from Anderson County and 589 from Brazoria County)."" 

On July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas. We are currently reviewing historical data to maintain an accurate time-series. 

On July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas appeared smaller than it was. The actual number of new cases in Texas that day was 8,112, not 6,020. 

On July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly ""new"" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.

Starting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.

On July 30, 2020, Texas noted that ""Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27–29. As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.""

On August 2, 2020, Texas noted that ""New data will not be posted on this dashboard on Sunday, August 2 due to a scheduled upgrade to the system that processes electronic lab reports. Data for Sunday will be posted with Monday’s data update.""

As of August 16, 2020, several commercial laboratories submitted previously backlogged test results to the Texas Department of State Health Services. As a result, new confirmed cases may not have occurred in the past 24 hours. The Texas Department of State Health Services is working to resolve these issues.

On September 14, 2020, Texas ""revised its method for reporting Total Tests,"" resulting in an approximately 300,000 unit decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and approximately 17,000 unit decrease in **Total antibody tests (specimens)**. We are currently investigating how this change affects our understanding of Texas' testing units.

The Texas Department of State Health Services regularly includes older cases identified by labs in their cumulative confirmed case counts. As a result, new cases reported may not necessarily have occurred in the past 24 hour period. When these increases are significant, we will specifically mention them in our daily update on twitter.

On August 31, 2020 we began publishing **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** for Virginia. This data has been collected daily since July 21, 2020. Previous data going back to February 27, 2020 was taken from state historical data as of July 21.

**Ever hospitalized** is calculated from the ""currently hospitalized"" and ""discharged"" data points on the Virginia Hospital COVID-19 dashboard. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Virginia reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

On June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.

On July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that ""DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.""

On August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.

As of September 18, 2020, Washington's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

Washington State reports **confirmed cases**, **laboratory tests**, and **deaths** as of the previous day. 

We report the most recent hospitalization data available for Washington. In some cases, this data may be reviewed and revised by the Washington State Department of Health. As a result, Washington considers hospitalization data complete after a 18-day lag period. In our data this lag is 20 days.
