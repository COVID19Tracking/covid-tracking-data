WI,"Negatives include only Wisconsin residents whose negative test results were reported electronically to DHS. This underestimates total negative test results. 
Deaths must be reported by health providers or coroners, and recorded by local health departments, to be counted. As of April 27, Wisconsin is reporting people tested. 
On March 30, WI revised down negatives from 16550 to 15856.",https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm,,,@DHSWI,https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm,Wisconsin,55,,false
WV,"Negatives = Totals - Positives. As of April 16, WV reports hospitalization + ICU + ventilator counts from 49 of 55 counties. Before April 16, those counts were unreliable -- based on reported percentages of completed investigations, an unpublished number.
As of May 23, West Virginia is separating out PCR and antibody tests; we report the number of PCR tests. Total tests might be impacted.

WY,"Negatives = Total - Positive.
The week of April 6, WY began separating confirmed & suspected cases; we now report only confirmed. From April 7 to April 13, our recovered count may be slightly high, as WY combined recovered confirmed cases + recovered probable cases. On April 22, total tests were revised down, resulting in a decrease in negatives. As of April 28, we are including the suspected cases with the confirmed cases.
As of May 16, Wyoming is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested",https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/,,@health_wyoming,https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/,Wyoming,56,,false
