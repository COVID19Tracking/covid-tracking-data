As of May 8, Arizona is reporting specimens tested, including both PCR and antibody tests. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

This data is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates to this value going forward will continue to take Arizona’s overall number as of that day, regardless of date admitted.

On July 18, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying the confirmed vs. probable breakdown of cases and deaths with its hover-over feature. We are going to back-fill the breakdown once Arizona provides the historical numbers.

On July 28 and July 29, we noticed that Arizona's Currently Hospitalized statistics decreased slightly while its Cumulative Hospitalized statistics increased significantly. We are unsure of the reason.

CA,"Before April 1, California was inconsistent in the timing of reporting so we used faster-updating county sources, we then standardized on the state data dashboard(s). This led to a drop in cases and deaths, as the state's data lags county sources.

The state reported a huge batch of negative tests on April 4 and again on April 22.

As of April 22, California now reports specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

On July 8, California data included a backlog of data from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. About 1000 of the 11,000 new cases are due to this spike in reporting.

From June 29 to July 5, California made a few revisions to daily case numbers, on July 17 we updated the values based on the most recent data from their dashboard.

Starting July 23, California has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system.

CO,"Negative = People Tested - Cases. Cases include people who test positive for COVID-19 AND people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and are a close contact to someone who tested positive. While Colorado publishes a confirmed/probable breakdown, this breakdown pertains to cases resulting in deaths rather than death certificates with COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause. As such, we do not count from it to maintain consistency with the total deaths figure from death certificates.

As of April 27, Colorado is reporting people tested. 

On June 14, Colorado revised some previous daily discharged number. This caused an overall decline in their recovered count. 

On May 15 (which we caught on our update May 16), Colorado started providing a new figure for deaths where COVID-19 is listed on the death certificate, in addition to the figure it already provided, deaths among laboratory-confirmed and probable cases (whether or not COVID was a cause of death). On July 1, we revised our historical data to reflect the deaths certificate figure instead of the deaths among cases. As such, it appears as if there is a drop from 1091 deaths on May 15 to 878 on May 16 in our data. 

On July 16, Colorado decreased the cumulative hospitalization number by 13.

As of May 29, CHA changed to only reporting the number of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; data for previous dates include patients with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This impacts the numbers for cumulative hospitalizations and recoveries.

On March 26, the dashboard stopped including non-residents in its visible counts, but they're still tracked behind the scenes.  

Per reporting [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html], the number of pending tests might be an under-count since it might include only public labs.

As of May 15, Florida is reporting both specimens (PCR and antibody) and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested. However, the ""people tested"" number reported on Florida's dashboard has come into question as of May 31, because this number is not fully de-duplicated. Florida's report states that: ""People tested on multiple days will be included for each day a new result was received.""

As of July 2, Florida is reporting PCR and antigen tests together.
