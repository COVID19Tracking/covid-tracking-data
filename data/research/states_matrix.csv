As of February 6, 2021, [Alaska no longer updates](https://twitter.com/alaska_dhss/status/1355349178335944708?s=21) their COVID-19 dashboards on weekends. As a result, we will be unable to update their data on Saturdays and Sundays. 

On February 12, 2021, Alaska [announced](https://twitter.com/Alaska_DHSS/status/1360413364065767424?s=20) via the official Alaska Department of Health and Social Services twitter that there would be no update to their data on February 15, 2021 due to the Presidents Day holiday.

On January 20, 2021, Alaska [reported](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2021/01/20/tracking-covid-19-in-alaska-record-23-deaths-and-167-infections-reported-wednesday/) a comparatively large increase of 23 deaths due to a review of death certificates.

On January 4, 2020, Alaska noted that ""counted deaths in Alaska include COVID-19 cases confirmed through a lab result as well as probable deaths based on confirmed COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological criteria as defined by the CDC with no confirmatory lab testing."" Due to this change we are unable to update the **Confirmed deaths** metric after January 4, 2020.

On January 1, 2021, Alaska noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021.

On December 25, 2020, Alaska announced on their dashboard that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020. 

On November 17, 2020, Alaska [announced](https://alaska-coronavirus-vaccine-outreach-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/cases-frequently-asked-questions) that “As of 11/17/2020, the cases dashboard will not be showing data on recovered and active cases due to the increasing State case load”. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

On November 16, 2020 we updated the **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** field to include only residents. We also deleted the time series for **Confirmed cases** because Alaska is lumping PCR and antigen testing for their case definition.

On November 16, 2020 we added **Cumulative Hospitalized** (which includes both residents and non-residents), although the value does not reflect current hospitalizations.

On November 7, 2020, Alaska announced that their testing dashboard would be ""temporarily disabled from November 6th to November 9th"" and that testing data could be accessed through their data summary tables. After originally using the data summary tables on November 7, we have reversed that decision, and reverted the values to their November 6th state. The frozen values were replaced on November 10, with values from the state's [Tests Dataset](https://coronavirus-response-alaska-dhss.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tests-dataset). 

On November 6, 2020, Alaska’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** decreased without explanation. As a result, `Negative`, which is calculated by subtracting **Total cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, decreased also.

On November 5, 2020, Alaska’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** increased from roughly 628k to 782k. We were unable to find an explanation for the increase.

As of September 18, 2020, Alaska's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.",#REF!,,TRUE,TRUE,AK is tracking cases by date of onset. ,"AK primary > ""All data are updated once daily by noon and are current through the previous day""

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On March 3, 2021, Alabama announced that the Alabama Department of Public Health processed 2114 positive PCR test results from tests preformed since May, 2020 on March 1, 2021. These test results will be included in the Confirmed cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) reported on March 3, 2021.

On February 6, 2021, Alabama's **Total antibody tests (people)** decreased from 140,376 to 108,818 without explanation.

On February 5, 2021, Alabama announced that they were experiencing a technical issue with their testing data. As a result, we were unable to update their Total antibody tests (people), Total PCR tests (people), and Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases.

On February 02, 2021, Alabama reported a large increase in Total antibody tests (people) of approximately 33,000 without explanation. Additionally, **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased by approximately 11,000 without explanation, resulting in a decrease in Negative PCR tests (people).

On January 30, 2021, Alabama noted on their data dashboard that due to maintenance and upgrades, the Alabama NEDSS Base System did not run on the evening of January 29, 2021, and as as result there would be no update to their dashboard on January 30, 2021. We were only able to update their Currently hospitalized and Ever hospitalized on January 30, 2021.

On January 22, 2021, Alabama noted that the Alabama Department of Public Health processed a backlog of 409 positive PCR tests dating back to November 19, 2020 through January 20, 2021, and that these tests would be included in their Confirmed cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) for January 22, 2021. As a result, not all new cases reported on January 22, 2021 were reported within the previous 24 hour period.

On January 13, 2021, Alabama reported that it is reviewing a large number of deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS), an endeavor which began on November 11, 2020 and will continue until further notice. As a result, death numbers during this time period reported may include historic deaths and may not accurately reflect new COVID-19 deaths. We urge caution when interpreting these numbers, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.

On January 5, 2021, Alabama noted on their COVID-19 dashboard that the cases reported on January 5, 2021 were high due to a delay in testing and reporting over the holiday weekend. On January 7, 2021, they noted that cases and deaths reported through the week of January 7, 2021, may be affected by holiday related reporting delays. We urge caution in using figures from this time period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.

On December 18, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 382 positive PCR test results from December 10, 2020 through December 13, 2020 will be classified as being reported on December 17, 2020.

On December 15, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 59 positive PCR tests and 479 positive antigen tests from September 29, 2020 through December 14, 2020 would be included in their data for December 15, 2020.

On December 12, 2020, Alabama announced that they processed a backlog of 398 positive antigen tests from July 7, 2020 through December 9, 2020.  These positive tests will be reported in Alabama’s Probable Cases and Cases (confirmed + probable) on December 12, 2020.

On December 12, 2020 through December 13, 2020, Alabama did not update their testing data by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update Total antibody tests (people), Total PCR tests (people), and Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated from Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases.

On December 9, 2020, Alabama processed a backlog of positive PCR and antigen test results from October 5, 2020 through December 7, 2020. This backlog makes up roughly 10% of Cases (confirmed + probable) reported on December 10, 2020.

On December 3, 2020, Alabama announced that: ""The Alabama Department of Public Health processed two backlogs totaling 1038 positive PCR results and 473 positive antigen results from two facilities on December 7. These will be classified as 1038 confirmed cases and 473 probable cases reported on 12/08/20 even though the tests were performed during November 30 through December 5, 2020.""

As of December 2, 2020, Alabama's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of  `totalTestsViral`. Before that, as of September 18, 2020, Alabama's total test results were switched to draw from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of being calculated via positive+negative. The timeseries are the same, but previously, Alabama's units had been unclear, and therefore we stored the series in our specimens field. 

On December 2, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 706 positive PCR tests performed from November 23, 2020 through November 29, 2020 would be included in their daily update for December 2, 2020.

On December 1, 2020, Alabama [announced](https://twitter.com/alpublichealth/status/1333790272648409093?s=21) that increased new case and death counts are due to delayed data from Thanksgiving.

On November 25, 2020, Alabama announced that the Alabama Department of Public Health Infection Disease and Outbreak team reviewed their electronic disease surveillance system and “updated some parameters”. As a result, **Recovered** increased by roughly 71k on November 25, 2020.

On November 14, 2020, Alabama announced that a backlog of 109 positive antigen results would be reported as probable cases on November 14, 2020. As a result, new **Probable cases** reported on November 14, 2020 were not all reported in the previous 24 hour period.

On November 11, 2020, Alabama announced via their [dashboard](https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7) that they have begun a review process for deaths from the Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS). According to Alabama, at least half of the **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** reported today (81 in total) are from this review. More deaths may be added from this review in the coming days.

On November 10, 2020 Alabama’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 700 without explanation.

On October 21, 2020, Alabama did not update their COVID-19 dashboard due to ""technical issues"".

On September 1, 2020, Alabama began displaying the number of people tested by antibody, over 50,000 individuals, separately from its main total tested field, which it clarified represents antigen and PCR testing. Its main total tested number dropped by over 25,000 the same day. We have reached out to the Alabama Department of Public Health to confirm this drop was due to the removal of the individuals tested by antibody.

On July 11, 2020, Alabama began using direct reports from hospitals for cumulative hospitalizations (which we report in our **Ever hospitalized** metric), rather than state case surveillance. Its number of cumulative hospitalizations increased by over 3,000 as a result. ",#REF!,,TRUE,TRUE,,"AL dash > ""Updates daily at 10am""

We do not count these individuals in our deaths metric, consistent with our policy of tracking only individuals with COVID as a cause of death where possible.

On February 28, 2021, Arkansas’s total Deaths decreased by over 200. Arkansas [stated](https://twitter.com/ADHPIO/status/1366163333225799682) that this decrease was because of data clean-up and deduplication.

During the week of September 20, 2020, Arkansas made some continual adjustments to its antigen people tested numbers, resulting in some fluctuation in its negatives and totals.

As of September 18, 2020, Arkansas's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The totals do not include repeat positives—counting individuals only for their first positive—but do count repeat negative tests.

On September 16, 2020, Arkansas’s **Negative Tests (PCR)** dropped by 26,801 tests, causing its **Total Tests (PCR)** to drop by 26,195 tests due to the reversal of a data dump of negative test results. It also added 140 **Probable deaths**, not all of which dated to September 16.

On September 3, 2020, Arkansas began reporting **Probable cases** according to the most recent CSTE definitions, in addition to confirmed cases. This added 423 new cases to AR’s **Total cases** number.

On Aug 15, 2020, Arkansas data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases from its dataset. These changes resulted in reductions in **Total cases**, **Ever hospitalized**, and **Ever in ICU** data. 

Between July 30, 2020 and September 17, 2020, Arkansas provided Total, Positive, and Negative Antigen tests (specimens) sporadically and then stopped reporting them. This data can be found in our API. ","Local Time – AR primary > image COVID-19 Update

Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.

On March 1, 2021, Arizona [announced](https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1366405875754291212?s=20) via the official Arizona Department of Health Twitter that due to death certificate matching, Confirmed deaths increased by 1, and Probable deaths decreased by 2. As a result, Deaths (confirmed + probable) decreased by 1.

On February 22, 2021, Arizona [announced](https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1363869914356994054?s=20) via the Department of Health's official Twitter that no new deaths were reported. Additionally, there was a decrease of 3 deaths (confirmed and probable) due to death certificate matching.

On January 18, 2021 Arizona [announced](https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1351183189100867586) via the official Arizona Department of Health twitter that their reported Deaths (confirmed and probable) decreased by one due to de-duplication of the data.

On January 9, 2021, Arizona [announced](https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1347930259170021376?s=20) that the number of COVID-19 patients in ICU was incomplete on their COVID-19 dashboard, and we sourced Currently in ICU from the official Arizona Department of Health twitter.

On December 28, 2020, Arizona [noted](https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1343575976026886144) that due to the holiday weekend, multiple days of case reviews were completed, resulting in the data for December 28, 2020 being higher than usual. As a result, they reported a larger increase in Confirmed cases than Total PCR tests (people), which caused their Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, to decrease.

As of December 10, 2020, Arizona's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. We backfilled the data for March 2 2020 through December 8 2020 using the time-series posted on Arizona's dashboard as [Diagnostic Tests Conducted](https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ELRv2testlevelandpeopletested/TestsConducted?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y). 

On December 1, 2020, Arizona [announced](https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1333791978992017408) that figures reported on December 1, 2020, would be higher than normal due to a delay in case review and reported over the Thanksgiving weekend.

On October 6, 2020, the Arizona Department of Health Services [announced](https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=AZDHS&utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&utm_content=3840149936&linkId=101333440) that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.

On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed. 

On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.

From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for **Cases** and **Deaths**, so we could not update **Confirmed Cases,** **Probable Cases,** **Confirmed Deaths,** or **Probable Deaths** during this period. We were still able to update the total data points for **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** and **Deaths (confirmed plus probable)**. We will backfill the separate confirmed and probable case and death data if Arizona provides historical numbers.

On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for **Cumulative hospitalized** to match Arizona's dashboard data for ""hospitalized by date admitted."" Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.","Local Time – AZ dash > ""Date Updated""

As a result, many of the deaths reported on February 25, 2021 occurred between December 3, 2020 and February 3, 2021. We urge caution when interpreting numbers from this period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics than individual figures.

On December 16, 2020, California [announced](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-338.aspx) that their cases for December 16, 2020 include 15,337 cases from previous days due to a change in case processing. It appears this new process will regularly include a higher volume of cases that were not identified within the previous 24 hours.

As of September 18, 2020, California's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

From July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.

From June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily **case** numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.

On July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.

As of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.

On April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged **negative test** data. 

Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in **cases** and **deaths**, as the state's data lags behind the county sources.",#REF!,,TRUE,,"As of 6/1, an additional 3,481 hospitalized, 618 in the ICU, are listed as ""Suspected COVID-19 cases""","CA primary > ""...with data from… "" >

CO,Colorado,,https://covid19.colorado.gov/data,https://www.twitter.com/cdphe,https://covid19.colorado.gov/news-0,https://turnips.covidtracking.com/#CO,,,"The **Recovered** data point we report for Colorado reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

On March 7, 2021, Colorado did not update its Currently hospitalized, **Confirmed cases,** **Probable cases,** **Recovered,** **Negative PCR tests (people)**, **Confirmed deaths**, and **Probable deaths** before our publication time

On February 10, 2021, Colorado noted that a temporary technical issue occurring on February 9, 2021, caused their dashboard to show incomplete case counts, while testing and percent positivity data did not update. As a result, we were unable to update testing data on February 10, 2021. A full update for all affected metrics is anticipated on February 11, 2021.

On January 26, 2021, Colorado [reported](https://covid19.colorado.gov/press-release/cdphe-adding-past-dated-cases-into-electronic-laboratory-reporting-system) that it would be adding over 3,000 past-dated cases from last year, particularly November and December 2020, reported by email and fax to its cumulative figures. This will cause larger than normal case counts over the next few days. We urge caution when using data from this period.

As of December 11, 2020, we are switching our deaths source for Colorado from deaths due to COVID to deaths among cases because of a processing lag. On September 1, 2020, there was only a 97 difference between the two figures: 1946 deaths among cases, vs. 1849 deaths due to COVID. On December 11, 2020, there is now a 759 difference—3759 deaths among cases, as opposed to 3005 deaths due to COVID. This means 20% of deaths among cases do not have death certificate data, vs. 5% in September, indicating a lag. Previously, on July 1, 2020, we had revised our historical data to reflect the death-certificate metric instead of the deaths-among-cases metric to comply with federal standards from the National Center for Health Statistics. We are also capturing a confirmed/probable breakdown from May 15, 2020 onward, which we did not used to capture since it was not provided for due to COVID.

On November 18, 2020, we shifted the entire time series of Colorado metrics by one day to match the date that the state reports on its dashboard. 

On November 13, 2020, the state of Colorado reported an increase in **Confirmed cases** that is less than that of the increase in **Positive PCR Tests (people)**. This resulted in a large decrease in **Negative (People or Cases)** metric due to our calculations. For now we are holding this metric, **Negative (People or Cases)**, constant until further notice.

As of August 13, 2020, Colorado's **total test results** reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On July 27, 2020, Colorado posted a notice that, ""Due to a server issue yesterday and today with our electronic laboratory reporting system, the number of tests completed and cases reported today, July 27, 2020, may be artificially low."" We report Colorado data a day after posting due to timing, so this note applies to the data published on July 28.

On June 14, 2020, Colorado revised previous ""daily discharged"" numbers. This caused an overall decline in their **Recovered** data.

The **Recovered** data point we report for Connecticut reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized. Connecticut stopped reporting hospital discharges on October 22, 2020, but the time series for the metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

As of February 23, 2021, Connecticut's `totalTestResults` field is taken directly from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated from positive + negative. We also cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) since it was calculated using mixed units.

On February 3, 2021, we updated the **Total Antigen Tests** and backfilled **Positive Antigen Tests** and **Negative Antigen Tests** from Connecticut's testing dataset provided by the state. Going forward, we'll be updating all these 3 metrics on weekdays. On February 23, we backfilled **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** from the same source so that it would only include PCR tests. This resulted in a drop at the topline of 345,693 tests, distributed over the timeseries.

On December 25, 2020, Connecticut announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Data-Tracker) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 through December 27, 2020 or on January 1, 2021 due to the holidays.

On November 26, 2020, Connecticut announced via a [press release](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/11-2020/Governor-Lamont-Coronavirus-Update-November-25) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020 will both be included in the November 27, 2020 update.

On November 5, 2020, Connecticut announced that a backlog of roughly 500 cases identified in August-November 2020, would be reported in the totals for November 5, 2020.

On June 24, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** (which can be found in our API and CSVs).

On June 18, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On May 29, 2020, Connecticut hospitalization data changed due to reporting laboratory-confirmed cases only. These changes resulted in a decrease in the numbers for **Ever hospitalized** and **Recovered** (which can be found in our API and CSVs). 

On May 27, 2020, Connecticut deduplicated some of its data, resulting in a decrease in **Cases** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.","Local Time – CT primary > in text at top of page ""As of...""

As a result, the majority of new deaths reported on February 5, 2021 were not identified in the previous 24 hour period. 

On February 7, 2021, Delaware noted that due to a technical issue it was reporting 260 cases reported to DPH on February 5 as well as the new cases reported on February 6.

On December 18, 2020, Delaware announced that due to laboratory reporting delays, the number of cases reported for December 17, 2020 is lower than previous days, and the number of cases reported for December 18, 2020 would be higher than previous days to make up for it. Because Delaware reports their data as of the previous day, this affects our data for December 18, 2020 and December 19, 2020.

Throughout the week of December 17, 2020, Delaware experienced technical issues with lab reporting. Please exercise caution when looking at their data from this period and be aware that 7 day averages are a more reliable metric than individual figures.

On December 7, 2020, Delaware announced that they would no longer be reporting **Recovered** as it was “no longer a true reflection of the number of persons that recovered from the disease” because this metric included only cases who had self-reported their recovery to the Division of Public Health. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

On October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our **Total Tests (PCR)** field for Delaware to the **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field.  

On September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system. We will backfill data for September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 to the best of our abilities when data is released

On September 6, 2020, the Division of Public Health reported a technical issue which caused between 175-200 positive cases to be excluded from Delaware's cumulative confirmed case count. These cases will be added in the coming days. As a result new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the past 24 hour period.

On August 27, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases and confirmed positives. This is a semi-regular occurrence which will impact Delaware's number occasionally. 

On July 25, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases, confirmed positives, and total tests.

On April 11, 2020, Delaware revised down negative test results from 10,415 to 9,624.","Local Time – DE dash > ""Data are current as of 6pm the previous day""

We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/).

[Per reporting](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html), the number of **pending tests** (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.

On January 1, 2020, Florida [announced](https://twitter.com/healthyfla/status/1345054200800157699?s=21) that they would not be updating their data on January 1, 2021 due to the New Year holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Florida's separate [hospitalization source](https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y). 

On December 25, 2020, Florida [announced](https://twitter.com/healthyfla/status/1342511673261711360?s=21) via the official Florida Department of Health twitter that they would not be updating their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Florida's separate [hospitalization source](https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y). 

On December 10, 2020,  we cleared **Deaths (confirmed)** from August 12 onward and are reporting them as **Deaths (confirmed and probable)**. On August 11, Florida added antigen tests to its data definition for deaths, which were previously PCR only.

On November 26, 2020, Florida did not update their data, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

On November 3, 2020, Florida’s **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** dropped by over 200 with no explanation.

On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer. 

On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our `totalTestEncountersViral` field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the `T_NegRes` and `C_AllResTypes` values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in `totalTestsPeopleViral`. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.

On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as **Total PCR Tests (People)** did not update.

As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our **Probable cases** field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.

On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, [the Florida Department of Health announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html) that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to ""an unforeseen technical issue"" that was ""not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health."" The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.

On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health [announced](http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html) that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.

On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for **Cases or Confirmed cases** (`positiveCasesViral` in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** (`positive` in our API) will be unaffected.

On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: ""The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.""

As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports **Now hospitalized** data for those patients with a ""primary diagnosis of COVID-19.""

Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in **Total PCR Tests (People)**, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in **Total Tests (PCR)**, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does **not** represent the number of specimens.

On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its **Negative PCR tests** metric. ",#REF!,TRUE,FALSE,,,"PDF

This change resulted in the addition of 162,028 cases in Georgia distributed over the timeseries from November 3, 2020 onward. Georgia does not provide a full history of this number, so on November 3, 2020 we record 29,937 probable cases for Georgia, many of which do not date to that day.

On January 6, 2021, Georgia stated on its dashboard that its data would be delayed several hours “due to a high volume of data to process.” Georgia’s data did not update before for our publication time. We were able to update their Currently hospitalized from their separate [hospitalization source](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6).

On November 13, 2020, we backfilled the **Total PCR tests (specimens)** time series to include only PCR testing, reported by the state in their data download file. This updates the previously reported series that until May 27, 2020 included both PCR and antibody tests.

On November 3, 2020, Georgia started reporting probable deaths and antigen positive cases in their COVID-19 Daily Status report. On November 4, we added the probable deaths in our **Deaths (probable)** field for November 3 and 4, causing the daily rise in deaths on the 3rd to appear as 480. This large increase includes the data dump of 450 probable deaths, many of which are not from the most recent 24 hour period. We also began recording the 29,937 antigen positive cases in our `positiveTestsPeopleAntigen` API field. We have reached out to Georgia's health department for clarity on the definition of this number. 

On October 21, 2020, Georgia did not update their ""COVID-19 Daily Status Report"" by the time of our daily update due to technical issues. In order to provide the most up to date data possible, we updated only **Current Hospitalizations**, which are sourced from a different Georgia government website.

As of September 18, 2020, Georgia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

As of August 28, 2020, we started reporting patients Now hospitalized from the [Georgia Geospatial Information Office](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6).

Guam's counts include 11 people tested at the San Diego naval base.

On March 5, 2021, Guam [announced](https://ghs.guam.gov/jic-release-no-592-covid-19-related-fatalities-reviewed-and-adjusted-132nd-133rd-fatalities) that, ""the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) Chief Medical Officer and Territorial Epidemiologist, in coordination with the Acting Chief Medical Examiner, have been conducting a review of all possible COVID-19-related deaths."" This review has led to 2 additional reported COVID-19 related deaths.

As of December 7, 2020, Guam’s Total PCR tests (specimens), Total antigen tests (specimens), Total antibody tests (specimens) will include all specimens reported. Previously they did not include follow up testing for known cases.

On November 21, 2020, we cleared Guam’s **Total PCR tests (People)** timeseries. Prior to November 21, we had believed that Guam’s negative counts represented people. However after outreach to Guam’s health department, we learned that the negatives represented specimens (while its positives represent cases). This change means Guam’s totalTestResults represent specimens excluding repeat positive results.

On November 18, 2020, Guam [announced](https://ghs.guam.gov/jic-release-no-454-results-112-test-positive-covid-19-two-gdoe-employees-test-positive-covid-19) that “Beginning next week, the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) will shift from daily situation reports to weekly reports in order to provide for more comprehensive data analysis. To reflect this, the Joint Information Center (JIC) will report profiles of confirmed cases on a weekly basis only.” As a result, Positive antigen tests (specimens) and Positive antibody tests (specimens) will only be updated once weekly going forward.

On September 3, 2020, Guam reported that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 5 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. From March 12, 2020 to September 2, 2020 Guam reported eight probable cases under the previous probable case definition. Due to the change, Guam has no cases that classify as probable cases as of September 3, 2020, and 8 cases have been removed from Guam's total case count.","Local Time – GU primary > ""Posted on"" date and time from most recent JIC release

On February 2, 2021, Hawaii's **Total PCR Tests (Test Encounters)** decreased by more than 15,000 and **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by more than 150 without explanation. 

On January 26, 2021, Hawaii reported 60 Deaths (confirmed + probable), the many of which may be due to a [death record review](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/01/25/state-finds-additional-covid-deaths-hawaii-following-records-review/). As a result, not all new deaths reported on January 26, 2021 may have been reported in the previous 24 hour period.

On December 25, 2020, Hawaii’s **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** decreased by 6184 without explanation.

On November 10, 2020, we switched the source for Hawaii’s **Currently Hospitalized** to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency’s COVID-19 dashboard. As a result, current hospitalizations decreased by 14. 

On November 6, 2020, Hawaii removed the Recovered metric from their dashboards.  Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, but the time series for this metric is available in the historical data and in our data downloads. 

As of October 9, 2020, Hawaii’s total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

On October 7, 2020, Hawaii stopped reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** and **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and began reporting **Total PCR tests (test encounters)**. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Total tests PCR (people)**, **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and `negative`, which was calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**, however the time series for the metrics are available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

On September 3, 2020, Hawaii included cases which had been previously diagnosed in their daily update due to an electronic laboratory reporting error."" As a result, new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the previous 24 hours.

As of August 5, 2020, we are collecting **Now hospitalized**, **Now in ICU**, and **Now on ventilator** data from the Lt. Governor of Hawaii's Instagram account, as we have determined that these are official statistics not available elsewhere. We have backfilled our time series for all available data from this source. On October 12, 2020, Hawaii made these metrics available on the state dashboard and we have used that source since.","Local Time – long calculation

On October 16, 2020, Iowa removed 12,831 tests from the state’s PCR test total. On the same day, 19,308 tests were added to the state’s antigen test total. We were unable to locate an official explanation, but these changes were likely the result of data cleaning and reorganization work.

On September 26, 2020, Iowa announced that due to a data update, roughly 27,000 antigen tests from long-term care facilities will be added to their COVID-19 antigen test data. This update will occur from September 26, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and will result in an increased number of antigen test tests reported in our data for Iowa. (Antigen data is available in our CSVs and API.)

ID,Idaho,https://public.tableau.com/profile/idaho.division.of.public.health#!/vizhome/DPHIdahoCOVID-19Dashboard/Home,https://coronavirus.idaho.gov/,https://www.twitter.com/IDHW,,,,,"Idaho's data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data. 

As of January 31, 2021, Idaho does not update their COVID-19 data on Sundays, and data reported on Mondays includes data for both Sunday and Monday. Because their data is on a one day lag in our timeseries due to late updates, we will be unable to update their data on Mondays, and data reported on Tuesdays will include two days of data. 

On February 12, 2021, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1360362916973744131) via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Twitter that there would be no update to their data on February 15, 2021 due to the President’s day holiday. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on February 16, 2021.

On January 20, 2021, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1352057437608583168) that two deaths had been removed from their total after updated records indicated that they were not due to COVID-19. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag due to late updates, this affects our Deaths (confirmed + probable) and Deaths (confirmed) for January 21, 2021

On January 18, 2021, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1351318456206032903) via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data published on January 19, 2021 would include two days of data. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries this affects our data for January 19, 2021 and January 20, 2021.

On January 12, 2021, Idaho reported 10 cumulative probable deaths on their dashboard,  a decrease from the 179 probable deaths reported the day before. We suspect that this is an error, and in order to ensure that our data is as accurate as possible, we carried over the existing value for Probable deaths on January 12, 2021.

On December 25, 2020, Idaho [announced](https://twitter.com/IDHW) via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On December 31, 2020, they [noted](https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1344793943876145152) that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021. Because Idaho's data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021.

On December 9, 2020, Idaho's **Total PCR Tests (People)** dropped from 492,265 from 494,914 with no explanation.

On November 26, 2020, Idaho announced that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our historical data due to consistently updating after we publish our daily update, we will be unable to update their data on November 27, 2020.

As of September 18, 2020, Idaho's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 4, 2020, after another period of missing data for **Hospitalized now**, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31. It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from 51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.

On July 22, 2020, Idaho reported 126 total **deaths** but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths, for a calculated total of 136 deaths. We treated the 33 probable deaths data point as an error and reported 126 total deaths for this date, including 103 confirmed and 23 probable deaths. See Idaho state page screenshots for July 22. 

From July 13 through July 21, 2020, Idaho was unable to report **Hospitalized now** data due to HHS regulation changes. Idaho retroactively made figures available for these days on July 21, 2020, and we revised our figures to match.

On July 8, 2020, Idaho revised its historical numbers for **Hospitalized now**. We updated our hospitalization figures for Idaho from March 23 to July 13, 2020 to match on July 17, 2020.

On July 3, 2020, Idaho revised down their **Recovered** data by about 1,500, noting that ""an error in auto-calculation was discovered.""

On June 5, 2020, Idaho reported a large batch of previously unreported tests. The state's **Total tests** number rose by approximately 2,500 more tests on June 5 than the seven-day average for new tests at that time.

As of April 9, 2020, Idaho reports **probable and confirmed cases** separately. ","Local Time – ID primary > ""Page last updated on...""

On March 4, 2021, we cleared the history of **Negative (people or cases)** in Illinois. This number mixed units and we no longer need it to calculate `totalTestResults`.

As of March 4, 2021, Illinois' `totalTestResults` is drawn from `totalTestsViral` instead of being calculated via positive+negative. This change had no impact on the number of tests at the topline. 

On March 4, 2021, we backfilled the history of Illinois' **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** from data by date of report it posts on its website to add history from March 10, 2020 to May 24, 2020, when we did not have captured data.

On January 22, 2021, Illinois began including all probable deaths reported since the beginning of the pandemic in the total case count. This means all 1,903 Probable deaths were included in the cases reported on January 22, 2021.

On November 6, 2020, Illinois [announced](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/news/public-health-officials-announce-10376-new-confirmed-cases-coronavirus-disease) that they ""will report confirmed cases and probable cases combined.” Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Confirmed** and **Probable cases** separately, however the time series for these metrics are available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

As of October 15, 2020, Illinois combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.

On September 4, 2020, Illinois reported over 140,000 new **Total PCR tests (in specimens)** and over 5,000 new **Cases.** According to the [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-19-pandemic-chicago-illinois-news-20200904-qun7unon5fhjbfhnsml4edwqia-story.html), ""The Illinois Department of Public Health said Friday there was significant slowdown in the agency's test reporting earlier this week that it is just catching up with.""

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Total cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)** in the absence of better data.

On March 6, 2021, Indiana announced that a new testing facility had been added to their electronic reporting system, resulting in 1241 Total PCR tests (people), 3769 Total PCR tests (specimens), and 445 Cases (confirmed in probable) reported on March 6, 2021. Additionally, their Ever in ICU decreased by 2 without explanation.

On February 26, 2021, Indiana announced that due to a historic load of negative tests, 663 older Total PCR tests (people) and 2150 Total PCR tests (specimens) would be included in their data for the day.

On February 4, 2021, Indiana announced that their deaths included “1,507 historical deaths identified through an audit of 2020 and 2021 COVID death records and test results”. As a result, the majority of new Deaths (confirmed + probable) and Deaths (confirmed) reported on February 4, 2021 were not reported in the previous 24 hours. We urge caution when looking at this figure.

On January 5, 2021, Indiana’s Currently in ICU decreased by 9 without explanation.

On November 29, 2020, Indiana announced that a historical backlog of roughly 2200 Total PCR tests (people) and about 4000 Total PCR tests (specimens) would be included in their data for November 29, 2020. The `Negative` field in the API will also be affected. As a result, new tests reported on November 29, 2020 were not all reported in the previous 24 hour period.

Kansas reports most of its data on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only, so there are often large changes in the values, which can represent 2-3 days of data.

The **Recovered** data point we report for Kansas reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized. Kansas notes that this metric only includes cases with available discharge information reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

On March 5, 2021, Kansas noted that a decrease in Deaths (confirmed and probable) was due to a death certificate review which revealed 4 cases where COVID-19 was not the main cause or contributing cause of death.

On December 25, 2020, Kansas announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.coronavirus.kdheks.gov/160/COVID-19-in-Kansas) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday.

On December 3, 2020, Kansas’ **Currently hospitalized** decreased by 342 without explanation. Kansas does not usually update their data on Thursdays.

On November 13, 2020, Kansas announced that there was a ""technical issue with displaying the number of negative tests and people tested"" but that no other metrics were effected. The values for **Total tests (people)**, and the `Negative` field in the API, were carried over and will be updated if they become available.

On November 12, 2020, Kansas’s **Total tests (people)** and `Negative` decreased without explanation.

On October 21, 2020, the **Currently in Icu** value for KS dropped from 81 to 1 on the state's dashboard. We recorded it, but expect it to be revised at another point. 

On July 15, 2020, Kansas began reporting additional data from hospitals, and at that time, data for the **Now hospitalized** metric was only available through July 10.

From July 1–July 3, 2020, we reported incorrect numbers for Kansas **Cases or Confirmed cases**. We have corrected the error.

As of May 7, 2020, **confirmed and probable cases** are included in the case totals.","Local Time – updates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

On November 26, 2020, Kentucky did not update their data by the time of our daily update, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

On November 12, 2020, Kentucky began reporting **Currently on ventilator** in their [COVID-19 Daily Summaries](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/KY/KY-tertiary-20201112-172508.pdf).

On November 7, 2020, Kentucky [reported](https://chfs.ky.gov/cvdaily/COVID19DailyReport1107.pdf) that ""due to a keystroke error, the PCR and total tested figures were incorrectly  reported on 11/6/2020."" This caused our **Total PCR tests (specimens)** to go up by ~168k on November 6, and to go down by ~130k on November 7. If we find an official source with a corrected value we will backfill it.

As of September 18, 2020, Kentucky's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

As of May 27, 2020, Kentucky reports antibody tests separately from PCR tests. 

On May 23, 2020, Kentucky revised down the state's figure for **Total tests**.","Local Time – KY primary > ""Current as of...""

LA,Louisiana,http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/,,https://www.twitter.com/LADeptHealth,,,,,"Louisiana reports probable deaths on a weekly basis.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total tests (PCR)** in the absence of better data.

On February 16, 2021, Louisiana announced that there would be no update to their data due to Mardi Gras.

On February 10, 2021, Louisiana [announced](https://twitter.com/LADeptHealth/status/1359562769205522436?s=20) that due to a processing error, the day's case and test counts are incomplete.

On February 7, 2021, Louisiana [noted](https://twitter.com/LADeptHealth/status/1358475247410905091?s=20) on its Department of Health's twitter that ""due to a technical issue, today’s reported case and test counts only include one day of data. Because of the daily removal of newly identified duplicates and out of state cases, the new case increase may not match the difference between today’s and yesterday's total case count."" Subsequently, on February 8, 2021, Louisiana [noted](https://twitter.com/LADeptHealth/status/1358838000961134593?s=20) that case and test counts reported on February 8, 2021 included two days of data.

On January 24, 2021, Louisiana [announced](https://twitter.com/ladepthealth/status/1353399882674016256?s=21) via the official Louisiana Department of Health twitter that the data reported on January 24, 2021 would only include lab reports from January 23, 2021. The remainder of the data that would normally have been reported on January 24, 2021 will be included in the data for January 25, 2021. 

On January 17, 2021, Louisiana announced that their deaths reflected deaths reported to the Louisiana Department of Health since January 14, 2021.

On January 15, 2021, Louisiana announced on their [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://ldh.la.gov/coronavirus/) that deaths will not be updated due to a system error. As a result, we were unable to update Deaths (confirmed and probable), Deaths (confirmed), and Deaths (probable).

On January 14, 2021, Louisiana announced that their data included a backlog of 916 cases dating back to November 11, 2020, and 4963 tests.

On December 25, 2020, Louisiana announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2002, due to the New Years holiday.

On December 2, 2020, Louisiana reported a backlog of 1551 cases. As a result, not all new cases reported on December 2, 2020 were reported in the previous 24 hour period.

On December 1, 2020, Louisiana reported that due to a processing error, data reported on December 1 also includes data from November 29-30.

On November 26, 2020, Louisiana announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

On November 20, 2020, Louisiana reported a backlog of 2,538 cases, with specimen collection dates ranging from 9/12-11/18, in its total cases. As a result, not all new cases reported on November 20, 2020 were identified in the previous 24 hour period. 

On November 13, 2020, Louisiana started reporting antigen and molecular tests separately on the state's dashboard.

On November 11, 2020, Louisiana did not update their COVID-19 Dashboard in observance of Veterans Day. As a result, no data was updated.

On August 30 Louisiana's reported data included 532 older cases that had not previously been reported; these cases had specimen collection dates ranging back to July 1.

On August 26, 2020, Louisiana started reporting Probable cases, this caused a notable increase in **Total cases**.

On June 19, 2020, Louisiana's data changed due to deduplication and the state's removal of out-of-state cases.

Between April 20 and April 24, 2020, Louisiana did not report testing data from commercial labs due to a state review of data.","Local Time – LA dash > ""This dashboard is updated daily by noon, except on Saturday.

On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021. Additionally, they noted that data reported on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021 would each include two days of data.

On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, they announced that the data for November 27, 2020 would include both the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020.

On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period"" instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.

As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ **Currently Hospitalized**, **Currently in ICU**, and **Currently on Ventilator** figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.

As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On September 2, 2020, MA [reported](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download) that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected. 

On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** before August 12, 2020 based on the state's ""Tests by Date"" dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.

On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting **probable cases** weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.

On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that ""Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test."" We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.

On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of **cumulative hospitalizations** and **confirmed and probable deaths** ""due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.""

On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report **probable cases** and **probable deaths*, causing **Total cases** and **Total deaths** to appear to increase sharply in our data. ","Local Time – MA primary > title ""COVID-19 Interactive Data Dashboard"" > ""Data as of:""

ME,Maine,https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml,https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml,https://www.twitter.com/mainedhhs,,,,,"Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

As of March 4, 2021, Maine's `totalTestResults` are drawn directly from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated by adding positive+negative, causing a drop of 225 in the daily increase in tests and 41,208 in the total tests, mostly due to the removal of non-resident tests.

On March 4, 2021, we backfilled Maine's **Total Tests (Specimens)**, **Positive Tests (PCR)**, **Total Antigen Tests** and **Positive Antigen Tests** metrics from the ""Daily lab results"" tab on Maine's dashboard.  The new values reflect testing on Maine residents only.

On December 25, 2020, Maine announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml) that some of their data would not be updated between December 25, 2020 and December 27, 2020 due to the holiday. As a result, we were unable to update Maine’s testing and current hospitalization data on December 25, 2020, and unable to update any data on December 26, 2020.

On December 9, 2020, Maine’s **Total Antigen Tests (specimens)** decreased by 248 on their COVID-19 page, which we believe was an error. The sum of **Positive Antigen Tests,** **Negative Antigen Tests,** and indeterminate antigen tests is 38,632 and Maine reported 36,632. In order to ensure that our data is as accurate as possible, we did not update Maine’s Total Antigen Tests (specimens) on December 9, 2020. (Antigen data is available in our CSVs and API.)

On November 30, 2020, Maine’s Total antigen tests (specimens) and Negative antigen tests (specimens) increased by roughly 11,000, and their Positive antigen tests (specimens) increased by about 400 without explanation. 

On November 26, 2020, Maine announced on their COVID-19 page that there would only be partial updates to their data from November 26, 2020 to November 29, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, we were unable to update testing data, and current hospitalization data on November 26, 2020, and unable to update all data points except for Currently hospitalized, Currently in ICU, and Currently on ventilator on November 27, 2020.

On November 11, 2020, Maine did not update testing and hospitalization data: only **Cases,** **Deaths,** and **Recovered** were updated.

On November 2, 2020, Maine started reporting antigen and molecular tests separately on the state's dashboard.

On June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of **cases**, **deaths**, **recoveries**, and **hospitalizations** on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for **Deaths (probable)** and **Deaths (confirmed)**.

As of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately.","Local Time – ME dash > ""...COVID-19 case investigation data included as of 11:59 PM the previous day""

MI,Michigan,"https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---,00.html",https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/,https://www.twitter.com/MichiganHHS,,,"https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98159-523641--,00.html",,"Michigan updates its **Recovered** metric weekly and does not update any data on Sundays.

Our source for **Now hospitalized** and **Now in ICU** data in Michigan generally updates on Mondays and Fridays only. 

Michigan combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. 

Michigan does not update their COVID-19 data on Sundays. As a result, new referrals of confirmed cases to the MDSS regularly affect the Confirmed cases we report on Mondays and over the weekend.

On March 4, 2021, we deleted the history of **Negative (people or cases)**, because they represented negative tests, not individuals. Now that `totalTestResults` is not calculated from positive+negative, we do not need to duplicate negative specimens in the people field.

As of March 4, 2021, Michigan's `totalTestResults` are drawn from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated via positive+negative. The total tests grew by 96,532, mostly due to addition of repeat positive tests.

On March 4, 2021, we fixed an error in a backfill from June 11, 2020, where we forgot to paste historical data from March 10, 2020 to March 16, 2020 for Positive Tests (PCR), Negative Tests (PCR), Total Tests (PCR), and Deaths.

As of July 7, 2020, Michigan updates its death figures three times a week after conducting reviews of death certificates. As a result, ""new"" deaths may not always reflect deaths in the past 24 hours.

On January 2, 2021, Michigan did not publish updated testing data by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update Total Antibody Tests, Total Tests (PCR), Positive Tests (PCR), Negative Tests (PCR), or Negative (People or Cases) on January 2, 2021.

On December 23, 2020, Michigan announced via a [press release](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-548250--,00.html) that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020, December 25, 2020, December 31, 2020, or January 1, 2021 due to the holidays.

On November 24, 2020, Michigan announced via a [press release](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-545993--,00.html) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to Thanksgiving holiday. On November 27, 2020, the state resumed data reporting where case counts would include cases since Wednesday, November 25, 2020. The state estimated that the average number of cases across November 26 and November 27, 2020 would be 8,581 cases per day.

On October 29, 2020, Michigan experienced connectivity issues resulting in some cases that would have been reported tomorrow to be reported today. This is due to the fact that the state has a strict 10AM cutoff for daily data reporting. This means the daily increase in cases encompasses more than one day's worth of data.

On October 15, 2020, Michigan announced that due to a laboratory result processing slowdown, several cases that would normally have been included in the October 14, 2020 update were reported on October 15, 2020. The issue has since been resolved. As a result, cases reported on October 15, 2020 may not have been reported within the last 24 hour period.

On June 11, 2020, we updated our historical data from a spreadsheet provided by Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services in order to reflect the lab-reported dates of **probable and confirmed cases** and **probable and confirmed deaths** by date of death.

Since March 10, 2020, Michigan has reported each day's Positive and Negative tests (people) by county but has never totaled these metrics for the state. We add new Positive and Negative tests (people) values daily to a running sum and report the total. ","Local Time – MI dash > tab ""Current Status"" > on right-hand side under ""MICHIGAN"" > [date]

On March 4, 2021, Minnesota [announced](https://twitter.com/dhmontgomery/status/1367573935160631297) that an audit discovered 4 private labs which had not been properly reporting test results to the Minnesota Department of Health. The data for March 4, 2021, includes roughly 31,000 older test results from 3 of these labs.

On January 28, 2021, Minnesota reported a delay in hospital data for January 27th, 2021. Reporting for both dates will be available tomorrow.

On January 11, 2021, Minnesota reported that their cases were lower than they otherwise would be by 598 due to data deduplication and that 9193 test results from January 10, 2021 will be reported on January 12, 2021 instead of January 11, 2021.

On January 4, 2021, Minnesota reported more new **Positive PCR tests (people)** than **Total PCR tests (people)**. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR tests (people)** minus **Positive PCR tests (people)**, decreased. Minnesota also noted during a [press conference](https://www.facebook.com/MPRnews/videos/885740615534664/) that roughly 650 of the cases reported on January 4, 2021, were a result of a backlog.

On December 25, 2020, Minnesota announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. On January 1, 2021, they announced that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday. Additionally, they noted that data reported on January 3, 2021, would include data for both January 1, 2021 and January 2, 2021.

On November 28, 2020 Minnesota announced on their COVID-19 page that the data reported on that day, would include data for both November 26, 2020, and November 27, 2020 due to the fact that they did not update their data on November 26, 2020 because of the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, figures reported on November 28, 2020 include data reported during the previous 48 hour period, as opposed to the previous 24 hours.

On November 26, 2020, Minnesota announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Because Minnesota’s data is “current as of 4 p.m. the previous day”, this change in their reporting schedule results in the data reported for November 27, 2020 being the data that would normally have been reported on November 26, 2020.

From September 27 to October 4, 2020, Minnesota did not report the current number of hospitalizations or patients in the ICU. We froze these values through October 2, 2020. On October 3, 2020, we removed the values in accordance with our policy of not carrying over current values for longer than 7 days. The values were restored on October 4, 2020.

As of September 18, 2020, Minnesota total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 
The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On September 17, 2020, we switched Minnesota's specimens timeseries to **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** based on correspondence with the state, which revealed that their ""total approximate number of completed tests"" reflects individuals tested per day.",#REF!,,TRUE,TRUE,,"MN primary > ""Updated daily at 11 a.m., with data current as of 4 p.m. the previous day.""

On November 21, 2020, Missouri’s **Total PCR Tests (People)** increased by less than **Confirmed cases**. As a result, **Negative (People or Cases)** saw a decline from the previous day since it is calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

On November 10, 2020, Missouri’s Total PCR tests (specimens), Negative PCR tests (specimens), Total PCR tests (people), Total antibody tests (specimens), Total antibody tests (people), Negative antibody tests (specimens), Total antigen tests (specimens), and Negative antigen tests (specimens) dropped without explanation.

On November 8, 2020, Missouri's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased from 2,672,288 to 2,654,691 with no explanation.

On October 14, 2020, Missouri testing numbers by people decreased. This resulted in a decrease in all total testing numbers (people) and negative cases. Testing numbers by specimen are unaffected.

On October 11, 2020, [Missouri announced that a database error had resulted in an “incorrect inflation” of cases in its October 10, 2020 report](https://www.kshb.com/news/coronavirus/missouri-covid-19-database-error-causes-incorrect-inflation-of-cases). When The COVID Tracking Project is able to obtain correct official data for October 10 from Missouri, we will update our dataset to reflect the correction.

On October 8, 2020, Missouri added current hospitalizations to their COVID-19 dashboard, and we began to capture this metric. Historical data is also available and we are working on backfilling our data for days where this metric was unavailable.

As of October 7, 2020, Missouri's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`. 

On September 28, 2020, Missouri removed the Positive and Negative antibody tests (people) metrics from their dashboards. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Positive antibody tests (people)** and **Negative antibody tests (people)**, however the time series for these metrics are available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

On September 5, 2020, the Missouri DHSS [added an additional 72 deaths](http://twitter.com/HealthyLivingMo/status/1302314149620391937?s=20) to their total count, ""most of which occurred June-August"".

The Northern Mariana Islands **Total PCR tests (specimens)** values decrease occasionally without explanation. We suspect this is due to some sort of data quality assurance or de-deduplication.

The Northern Mariana Islands provides irregular data updates, so changes in values often represent multiple days of data.

On July 23, 2020, we switched our **Total tests** units to the people-tested metric reported by the Northern Mariana Islands, which led to a drop in total tests. We will backfill total tests data for the territory as soon as we are able to do so.","Local Time – MP query > ""MAX_reportdt:""

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

From May 21, 2020 through May 26, 2020, we briefly captured Mississippi's Positive antibody tests (specimens) through state press conferences. As of May 26, 2020, Mississippi no longer reports this metric. On February 11, 2021, we cleared Mississippi's Positive antibody tests (specimens) timeseries to ensure that our data is as accurate and consistent as possible.

On October 25, 2020, Mississippi announced that COVID-19 data for October 24, 2020 and October 25, 2020 would be published on Monday. As a result, Mississippi did not update on October 24, 2020 and October 25, 2020.

On September 15, 2020, Mississippi resumed reporting current hospitalizations, ICU, and ventilations on the source we have historically used for this metric. We are working to backfill these data points in our historical data.

On September 11, 2020, we discovered a new source for Mississippi current hospitalizations and current ICU admissions on the Mississippi State Department of Health website.

Between June 17 and June 22, 2020, Mississippi experienced technical difficulties with their reporting system. We filled in five days of **case** and **death** data on June 22, 2020.

On May 26, 2020, news reports indicated that 95 antibody tests had returned positive in Mississippi, but we have not found more recent data since then for this metric.

As of May 23, 2020, Mississippi is separating out PCR and antibody tests. We now report both separately.

This change resulted in a decrease of 5147 tests due to the removal of probable cases from the figure.

On March 6, 2021, Montana’s Confirmed cases decreased by 173 without explanation.

On March 5, 2021, we backfilled the history of Montana's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** using data from its dashboard. This allowed us to get historical testing data we did not have from March 7, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Additionally, we cleared the values in Montana's **Negative (people or cases)** time series back to March 21, 2020. These values mixed units and are no longer needed since `totalTestResults` will no longer be calculated via positive+negative.

On March 2, 2021, Montana's Confirmed cases decreased by 91 without explanation.

On February 25, 2021, Montana’s Confirmed cases decreased by 83 without explanation.

On February 24, 2021, Montana’s **Confirmed cases** decreased by 117 without explanation.

On January 27, 2021, we discovered that the **Confirmed cases** figure we had been capturing for Montana included both confirmed and probable cases, and cleared their **Confirmed cases** timeseries from April 30, 2020 through January 26, 2021 as a result. Beginning on January 27, 2021, we will capture **Confirmed cases** and **Probable cases** from the demographics tab of their dashboard, and will backfill our timeseries as we are able to.

On December 25, 2020, Montana announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://montana.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=7c34f3412536439491adcc2103421d4b) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021 due to the holidays. We were able to update Currently in ICU and Currently on Ventilator from Montana's separate [hospitalization source](https://dphhs.mt.gov/publichealth/cdepi/diseases/coronavirusmt/demographics).

On December 14, 2020, Montana announced that due to updates to their data reporting system on December 13, 2020, no new cases could be reported on December 13, 2020. We were unable to update Cases (confirmed + probable) and Negative PCR tests (people) on December 14, 2020.

On November 16, 2020, Montana’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their Total PCR tests (specimens) without explanation. As a result Negative test results which are calculated by subtracting Confirmed cases from Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased.

If previous values become available from North Carolina we will backfill the complete time series. 

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** in the absence of better data.

As of March 6, 2021, North Carolina no longer updates their COVID-19 data on Sundays. 

On March 3, 2021, we cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) in North Carolina. This number mixed units, but we kept it because we relied on it for `totalTestResults.` Now, with `totalTestResults` drawn from `totalTestsViral`, we no longer need the negatives field to be filled.

As of March 3, 2021, North Carolina's `totalTestResults` are drawn from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated via positive+negative. This update resulted in a drop of 880,339 tests, mostly due to the removal of antigen tests from the number.

On March 2nd, 2021, we backfilled North Carolina's **Total PCR tests (specimens)** from the state provided dataset. This added 2 months of data to the beginning of the series (March 17, 2020 to May 17, 2020). This update also separates the captured lumped PCR and antigen tests previously stored in **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, starting on September 22, 2020.

On February 28, 2021, North Carolina [noted](https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/NC/NC-20210228-115701.png) that its data dashboards would not update on that day in order to make changes to improve system performance.

On February 3, 2021, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services [reported](https://twitter.com/ncdhhs/status/1357052211252068354) that the day's case counts were much larger than usual because of the inclusion of a backlog of nearly 8,000 cases identified at FastMed clinics during December 2020 and January 2021. 

On January 18, 2021, North Carolina announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard) that there will be no daily update due to the holiday, and that their data will next be updated on Tuesday, January 19, 2021.

On January 13, 2021, North Carolina reported that technical issues occurring on January 12, 2021 prevented processing of case and testing data into their COVID reporting system. As a result, case and testing data reported on January 13, 2021 are lower than they would have been had all the data been processed, and case and testing data on January 14, 2021 will be increased, since it will include the previous day's data.

On December 30, 2020, North Carolina announced on its [dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard) that due to holiday-related disruptions and technical issues, data reported on December 30, 2020 was artificially higher than usual and includes 36 hours of data, while data reported on December 31, 2020 was artificially lower than usual and includes only 12 hours of data.

On December 24, 2020, North Carolina announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020, or December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday.

On November 26, 2020, North Carolina announced on their [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the thanksgiving holiday. However, on November 27, 2020, they will provide data retroactively for November 26, 2020 and we will backfill our historical data accordingly.

On November 13, 2020, the state of North Carolina [announced](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/NC/NC-20201113-113612.png) that they are re-defining hospitalization data based on new guidance, whereby hospitalizations are counted by the entire length of stay and not just by length of isolation. This change will likely affect our Now hospitalized metric for the state

On September 26, 2020, North Carolina started reporting deaths among individuals who had tested positive via antigen. We record this figure in our **Deaths (probable)** field.

On September 25, 2020, North Carolina started reporting probable cases which caused the **Total Cases** to increase by 4,563.

On August 12, 2020, North Carolina [announced](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-corrects-covid-19-testing-totals-after-identifying-labcorp-reporting) a major correction in its **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, resulting in a decrease of more than 220,000 reported tests.

ND,North Dakota,https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases,,https://www.twitter.com/NDDOH,,,,,"On March 7, 2021, North Dakota’s Total PCR tests (people) decreased by 75 and Negatives decreased by 109 without explanation.

On February 13, 2021 North Dakota's reported **Total Tests (PCR)** declined by 822 without explanation.

On February 10, 2021, North Dakota's Confirmed cases decreased by 32 due to an [assessment of software malfunction](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction).

On February 9, 2021, North Dakota’s Confirmed cases dropped by 62 due to an [assessment of software malfunction](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction), from 93,610 to 93,548. Additionally, their Cases (confirmed + probable) dropped by 11.

On February 6, 2021, North Dakota’s Confirmed cases decreased by 36 due to an [assessment of software malfunction](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction). 

On December 30, 2020, North Dakota began reporting antigen in addition to PCR testing. From December 30, 2020 to January 3, 2021, we captured those numbers combined in our Total Tests (PCR) and Total Test Encounters (PCR) fields. On January 4, 2021, we began reporting these figures separately and revised our historical data to reflect the separate antigen and PCR numbers North Dakota provides.

On December 25, 2020, North Dakota announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update on January 1, 2020 due to the New Years holiday.

On December 15, 2020 through December 17, 2020, North Dakota announced that they were resolving a technical issue with their dashboard. As a result, the hospitalization dashboard was unavailable, and we were unable to update their **Now in ICU**, **Ever hospitalized**, and **Ever in ICU** metrics.

On December 10, 2020, we backfilled **Confirmed cases**, **Probable Cases** and **Total cases** from March 10, 2020 until December 9, 2020. We also cleared our **Deaths (confirmed)** and **Deaths (probable)** metrics because the number we reported as confirmed included antigen tested individuals.

On December 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting **Probable Cases,** which it defines as individuals with a positive antigen test.

On December 8, 2020, North Dakota  announced that they would not be updating their website due to site construction as they prepare to add antigen tests to their dashboard. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 8, 2020.

On December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their COVID-19 dashboard to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s **Currently hospitalized** will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.

On December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our **Deaths (confirmed)** source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.

On October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the state dashboard annotation, the ""Hospitalized with COVID"" figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are ""Hospitalized due to COVID"". We are using the ""Hospitalized with COVID"" figure for our **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the ""Due to COVID"" Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.

On November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.

On November 12, 2020, North Dakota announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.

On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).

On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their [daily news release](https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0).

As of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.

On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.

Nebraska's cumulative data values often decrease without explanation, likely due to deduplication or other data corrections.

Nebraska’s **Recovered** numbers occasionally decrease without explanation.

On January 20, 2021, Nebraska reported that its dashboard would be down until “later in the week” due to system maintenance. The Nebraska Department of Health reported **Deaths** and **Now hospitalized** values manually.

On January 13, 2021, Nebraska’s Recovered decreased by 1864 without explanation.

On January 9, 2021, Nebraska’s Deaths (confirmed + probable) decreased by 78 without explanation.

On January 3, 2021, Nebraska’s **Recovered** value decreased by nearly 4,000 without explanation.

On December 26, 2020, Nebraska’s **Ever hospitalized** decreased by 3, their Recovered decreased by 4265, and their Deaths (confirmed + probable) decreased by 10 without explanation.

On November 13, 2020, Nebraska's cumulative hospitalized count dropped by 21 without explanation.

On November 6, 2020, Nebraska removed 114 recoveries without explanation.

On October 30, 2020, we backfilled the full time series for Nebraska's Total Tests into our ""Total Tests (PCR)"" metric from a Nebraska GIS query. At the same time, we filled our Positive Tests (PCR) and Negative Tests (PCR) from the same query.

On September 20, 2020, Nebraska started publishing **Total Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **People Tested (in people)**, and we started collecting the Total Tests daily into our Total Tests (PCR) metric.

On November 22, 2020, Nebraska's **Recovered** metric dropped from 56,605 to 16,068 without explanation.","Local Time – NE dash > tab ""Last 14 Day Positive Cases"" > ""Last updated:""

NH,New Hampshire,https://www.nh.gov/covid19/dashboard/case-summary.htm,https://www.nh.gov/covid19/,https://www.twitter.com/NHPubHealth,,,https://www.nh.gov/covid19/dashboard/overview.htm#dash,,"The **Recovered** data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

New Jersey does not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** everyday. If **Total PCR tests (specimens)** is not updated, we are unable to update their **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR tests (specimens)** minus **Confirmed cases**.

On March 6, 2021, New Jersey’s Ever hospitalized decreased by 916 without explanation.

On February 8, 2021, New Jersey [reported](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1358841345859870721) that today's data is artificially low due to electronic lab reporting issues. Data reported on February 9, 2021 is expected to correct the backlog.

On January 15, 2021, New Jersey’s Probable cases decreased from 59,881 to 31,717 on their [data dashboard](https://covid19.nj.gov/#live-updates) without explanation. We believe this decrease may have been a mistake and sourced this data point from the [underlying data layer](https://services7.arcgis.com/Z0rixLlManVefxqY/arcgis/rest/services/DailyCaseCounts/Feat[…]27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27TOTAL_AG_CASES%27%7D%5D) (today's value is 60,791) in order to avoid the decrease.

On January 8, 2021 New Jersey’s Probable cases increased from 53,967 to 72,123 without explanation. This affected their Cases (confirmed + probable), which is calculated as Confirmed cases plus Probable cases in the absence of an explicit total case number. On January 9, 2021, their Probable cases decreased from 72,123 to 56,147. Because of this, we believe that the figure reported on January 8, 2021 was a mistake, and have corrected the number in our timeseries. 

On October 23, New Jersey's reported **Ever hospitalized** value increased dramatically from 24,517 to 37,222 with no explanation we could find: this was probably a one-time addition of backlogged data.

On August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's **Probable deaths** with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregular reporting.

On August 4, 2020, New Jersey's **Now hospitalized** number decreased by 268 people.

On July 19, 2020, New Jersey's **Total cases** decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.

On July 16, 2020, New Jersey's **Recovered** figure decreased.

On May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for **Recovered** to rise by approximately 7,000 people. ","Local Time – NH primary > ""data updated as of...""

Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

On November 19, 2020, we removed the timseries of **Recovered** in Nevada because it reflected only recoveries in licensed facilities. 

As of October 30, 2020, Nevada's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as `totalTestsPeopleViral`.

On October 29, 2020, Nevada’s Total Tests (PCR) increased by a smaller amount than the increase in Cases. Because Negative test results are calculated by subtracting Confirmed cases from Total PCR tests (people), Negative test results decreased on October 29, 2020.

On October 15, 2020, Nevada stopped reporting the number of unique people who tested negative on their dashboard without explanation. We carried forward the last reported number of people tested negative between October 15 and October 21 (our policy when a metric goes missing without notice is to “freeze” the number for up to seven days to allow states to recover from temporary reporting problems). Since our API uses the sum of positive+negative tests to calculate the total number of tests in Nevada, this caused the number of total tests on those dates to increase only by the number of positives. On October 21, 2020, we updated the number of Nevada’s negative tests for October 15 through October 20 based on a calculation of (Total people tested – Cases)

On October 15, 2020, Nevada stopped reporting **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and began reporting **Total PCR tests (test encounters)**. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, however the time series for the specimens metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads.

Because we collect state data, not city or county data, these New York City probable deaths from COVID-19 are not included in our dataset. The total number of deaths from COVID-19 for New York State reported by the CDC is significantly larger than the total number of deaths from COVID-19 reported by New York State. 

The **Recovered** data point we report for New York reflects the number of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

New York State has not reported new **Ever hospitalized** data since June 2, 2020.

As of November 23, 2020, New York's `totalTestResults` are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

OH,Ohio,https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/,,https://www.twitter.com/OHdeptofhealth,https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/ODH-News-Releases,,https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/key-metrics/cases,,"As of March 2, 2021, Ohio updates their mortality figures twice a week as death certificate information is received and verified from the National Center for Health Statistics. As a result of this change, Deaths (confirmed + probable) decreased from 17,346 to 17,189 on March 2, 2021. To allow our data quality team time to evaluate this change, we did not record this change on March 2, 2021, and backfilled our timeseries on March 3, 2021.

As of March 2, 2021, Ohio no longer reports Deaths (confirmed) and Deaths (probable) on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/). As a result, we are unable to update these metrics.

From February 10, 2021 through March 1, 2021, Ohio reconciled their death data. As a result, death figures from this period may fluctuate more than normal, and may include deaths which were not reported in the previous 24 hours. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics. Our data quality team will continue to investigate how best to handle changes to their data.

Ohio continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause slight differences between their historic data and ours. 

On February 10, 2021, Ohio [announced](https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-02-10-20) that up to 4,000 COVID-19 deaths were underreported in the state’s reporting system and on their COVID-29 dashboard. These deaths will be added to their counts over the week on February 11, 2021. As a result, new deaths will be substantially higher than normal throughout this period. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period. Our data quality team will continue to investigate how best to handle the addition of these death. Approximately 650 of the deaths reported on February 11, 2021, 2500 of the deaths reported on February 12, 2021, and 1125 of the deaths reported on February 13, 2021 are a result of this reconciliation. On February 15, 2021, Ohio noted that they were continuing to reconcile deaths through a deep review of data which may result in fluctuations in death data.

On January 6, 2021, we switched Ohio's `totalTestResults` to draw from `totalTestsViral` instead of by calculating from positive+negative. 

On December 29, 2020, Ohio provided a timeseries of Total Tests (PCR), Positive Tests (PCR), Total Antigen Tests, and Positive Antigen Tests. On January 6, 2021, we backfilled all 4 metrics from this download, which resulted in the addition of three new metrics (positive tests PCR, positive tests antigen, total tests antigen) and a full history for Total Tests (PCR).

On December 25, 2020, Ohio announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview/) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data for December 26, 2020 will include numbers from both December 25, 2020 and December 26, 2020. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday, and that data for January 2, 2021 will include numbers from both January 1, 2021 and January 2, 2021. 

On December 19, 2020, Ohio announced that the case numbers for December 19, 2020 may be slightly lower than otherwise due to a technical issue.

On December 8, 2020, Ohio announced that their data for December 8, 2020 includes a backlog of roughly 13,000 antigen tests dating back to November 1, 2020. As a result not all new **Probable cases** and **Total cases** were reported in the previous 24 hour period. This followed the state reporting on it's COVID-19 Dashboard that the data was incomplete and ""because of unprecedented volume, thousands of reports are pending review"" from November 18, 2020 to December 7, 2020.  

On November 26, 2020, Ohio announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that there would not be a data update on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, the data that would normally have been reported on November 26, 2020 will be included in the November 27, 2020 update.

On November 23, 2020 Ohio announced that their data for November 23, 2020 would include two days worth of positive test results which were delayed due to technical issues affecting lab reporting. Additionally, on November 23, 2020, Ohio did not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** by the time of our daily update. Because `Negative` is calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, we did not update them on November 23, 2020.

On November 18, 2020, Ohio reported 5246480 **Total PCR tests (specimens)** - the same number that was reported on November 15, 2020, and a drop of roughly 102k tests from November 17, 2020. Because Ohio announced that their data for November 18, 2020 would be incomplete, and we suspect this decrease was a result of that, we did not update **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, or `Negative` on November 18, 2020.

OK,Oklahoma,https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/weekly-epidemiology-and-surveillance-report.html,https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/,https://www.twitter.com/HealthyOklahoma,https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/news,,https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom.html,,"On February 27, 2021, Oklahoma's Total PCR Tests  dropped by 3,314 without explanation.

On February 11, 2021, Oklahoma announced via a [press release](https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/2021/february/situation-update--covid-19-02-11-2021.html) that due to delayed reporting by facilities, and time taken to investigate previously deferred cases, the “majority” of new deaths reported on February 11, 2021 occurred in November, 2020.

On February 3, 2020, the Oklahoma Department of Health [cautioned](https://twitter.com/healthyoklahoma/status/1357016405586178050?s=21) that the 52 deaths reported on this date occurred between January 4, 2021 and February 1, 2021, with 32 of them having occurred since January 27, 2021.

On January 10, 2021, Oklahoma [noted](https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/2021/january/state-department-of-health-comments-on-spike-in-covid-19-case-nu.html) that the rise in COVID-19 cases was in part due to a “decrease in testing and a less consistent reporting schedule over the holidays”. We urge caution when interpreting their data from this time period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable figures than individual numbers. 

On December 27, 2020, we cleared Oklahoma's **Confirmed cases** field from October 19 onward. On September 8, 2020, Oklahoma [announced](https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/2020/september/situation-update-covid-19-09082020.html) in a press release that it would transition to counting both confirmed and probable cases, instead of just confirmed cases. This change appears to have taken effect on October 19, 2020, when OK [stopped calling](https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/2020/october/situation-update-covid-19-10192020.html) its cases ""confirmed positive cases"" in press releases, as it had before, switching the wording to ""cases."" 

On December 22, 2020, Oklahoma noted via a [press release](https://oklahoma.gov/covid19/newsroom/2020/december/osdh-releases-covid-19-reporting-cadence-for-upcoming-holidays.html) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data for December 26, 2020 would include only the data that would have been reported on December 25, 2020, and the data for December 27, 2020 would include data for both December 26, 2020 and December 27, 2020. As a result of their executive order reports being on a one day lag, we were able to report all metrics except for Confirmed cases, Cases (confirmed + probable), Ever hospitalized, Recovered, and Deaths (confirmed + probable) on December 25, 2020. We were only able to update Confirmed cases, Cases (confirmed + probable), Ever hospitalized, Recovered, and Deaths (confirmed + probable) on December 26, 2020. They also noted that this change in reporting schedule may cause some data to be “artificially inflated”, and as with all data from this period, we urge caution is using these figures.

On December 17, 2020, Oklahoma announced that due to technical issues on December 16, 2020, they were unable to update their testing data. As a result, we were unable to update **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, **Positive PCR tests (specimens)**, **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, or Negative PCR tests (people) on December 17, 2020.

As of December 16, 2020, Oklahoma’s **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** include only patients with confirmed COVID-19. Prior to December 16, 2020, they included confirmed COVID-19 patients and people under investigation.

On December 4, 2020 Oklahoma announced that the increase of 4,287 cases reported today was largely attributable to an issue with the state's reporting system, which resulted in the inclusion of backlogged cases from December 2 to December 4.

On November 25, 2020, Oklahoma announced via a [COVID-19 Situation update](https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/articles/situation-update-covid-19-11252020) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Because much of the data that we get for Oklahoma is sourced from their executive order reports, which are on a one day lag, we will only be able to partially update Oklahoma’s data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020 as a result.

On July 19 and July 20, Oklahoma noted that reported **Total cases** numbers were inaccurately low due to technical issues. 

Prior to April 10, 2020, Oklahoma reported ""Positive (Out-of-State)"" results. We excluded these figures from our data, as we assumed these individuals were isolated outside the state.",#REF!,,FALSE,,,"OK primary > tile ""OK Summary"" > ""Cases updated as of:""

On February 8, 2021, we cleared the history of our confirmed and probable cases fields in Oregon. Before Oregon switched to reporting tests in units of specimens, we had used its figures for people testing positive to represent confirmed cases and subtracted that number from total cases to get probable cases. However, it turned out that Oregon's people tested figure included people testing positive with antigen, so the positive people tested figure did not accurately reflect confirmed cases.

On January 29, 2021, Oregon [announced](https://twitter.com/ohaoregon/status/1355286471687745537?s=21) that their COVID-19 case database would be down “for server and file migration maintenance” on January 30, 2021, and as a result there would be no update to their data on January 31, 2021. Because Oregon’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries due to late updates, we were unable to update their data on February 1, 2021.

As of December 9, 2020, Oregon’s total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. This change will cause Oregon’s `totalTestResults` to begin on March 29, 2020 instead of March 4, 2020. Because Oregon’s totalTestsViral represent only electronic laboratory reporting, whereas its cases and negatives represented tests from all sources, this change causes a decrease of 10,296 tests in `totalTestResults` on March 29. The old numbers remain available by summing the positive and negative fields of our API.
In addition, Oregon has not reported their total tests in people units since December 2, 2020 and they indicated that they will not continue to report total tests in people, so we have removed any values in **Total PCR tests (people)** we previously carried over.

On December 3, 2020, Oregon removed its total people tested metric, after adding total specimens on December 1. Because they did not provide a full timeseries of specimens, as of December 4, we switched our totalTestResults from people to specimens on December 2, 2020, and stopped calculating **Negative (people or cases)**. This causes an artificial increase of totalTestResults by 960,248 on that day. 

On December 1, 2020, **Negative (people or cases)** decreased by 3,258 from 968,686 to 965,428. Oregon did not post an explanation. Since `totalTestResults` are computed positive+negative in the state, this caused `totalTestResults` to drop by 2,035.

On November 5, 2020 we began reporting current hospitalizations from [Oregon's COVID-19 Update Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/oregon.health.authority.covid.19#!/vizhome/OregonCOVID-19Update/HospitalCapacity). Previously we had been capturing these metrics on the [Oregon Health Authority page](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19).

On November 4, 2020, Oregon stopped reporting current hospitalization data on the [Oregon Health Authority page](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19), and so we did not update Oregon's current hospitalization data. Current hospitalization data is provided on Oregon's data dashboard, but it lags a day behind the other source. We will evaluate this change and resume reporting Oregon hospital data when we are sure we can preserve the time series. 

On October 9, 2020, Oregon [announced}(https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/OHA-changes-recovered-cases-reporting.aspx) they were removing the **Recovered** metric from their reporting and working on a revised definition of recovered. Due to this we cannot continue reporting **Recovered**, however the time series for the metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads. 

As of June 6, 2020, Oregon only releases updated data for **Cases (confirmed plus probable)**, **Deaths (confirmed and probable)**, and **Negative PCR tests (people)** metrics on the weekend.",#REF!,,TRUE,,,"OR primary > title ""Situation in Oregon"" > ""Data from...""

As a result of this calculation, this figure may fluctuate from day to day. We urge caution when interpreting this data.

On February 9, 2021, Pennsylvania [announced](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1286) via a press release that case data for February 8, 2021 would be low as a result of “technical maintenance to the data server on Sunday”. Data for February 9, 2021, will include cases from “catch-up reporting because of lengthy server downtime”. Additionally, they noted that death data is sourced from a different server and was not affected.

As of February 2, 2021, Pennsylvania's totalTestResults field is drawn from the 'totalTestEncountersViral' field instead of being calculated from positive+negative.

On February 1, 2021, we backfilled the full time series of **Total Test Encounters (PCR)**, from data now available on [Open Data Pennsylvania](https://data.pa.gov/Health/COVID-19-PCR-Test-Counts-March-2020-Current-Statew/r6ti-va88), and cleared our **Total Tests (PCR)** column. Going forward, we will enter PA's ""Total PCR Tests"" into Our **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** column rather than **Total Tests (PCR)**, as the state's site describes the data as encounters.

On January 28, 2021, Pennsylvania [noted](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1273) that their case counts included backlogged antigen testing data from urgent care centers collected over a week ago. Pennsylvania will continue to report this data over the next few days, which will in turn affect our reported case counts.

On January 4, 2021, Pennsylvania [announced](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1231) ""3,226 additional positive cases of COVID-19, in addition to 4,579 new cases reported Sunday, January 3 for a two-day total of 8,992 additional positive cases of COVID-19."" In addition, case counts for January 4, 2021 are ""atypically low"" due to technical maintenance.

On December 28, 2020, Pennsylvania's Total PCR tests (specimens) value increased by ~690,000 from 7,202,533 tests to 7,892,184 tests. On December 29, 2020, this Total PCR tests value decreased by ~580,000 to 7,312,858 tests. We were unable to find an explanation for this fluctuation.

On December 14, 2020, Pennsylvania’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 297k without explanation.

On September 3, 2020, Pennsylvania [clarified](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx) that the test numbers they have been reporting previously are in units of unique people and began publishing new test data in units of specimens. On September 4, 2020, we therefore moved the appropriate historical data to the **Total tests (people)** field and began capturing **Total PCR tests (specimens)**. 

On April 23, 2020, Pennsylvania revised down its total **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** from 1,622 to 1,421 to exclude some probable deaths that needed further confirmation to be linked to COVID-19","Local Time – PA dash > ""Information last updated at...""

On March 7, 2021, Puerto Rico's dashboard link was broken and required a login. As a result, data will be frozen until a suitable replacement is found.

Puerto Rico does not report test data on its data dashboard. Data for **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** and **Positive PCR Tests (in specimens)** is taken from infrequent press reports. The most recent test data for Puerto Rico is taken from a [Departamento de Salud press release](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/files/5307568/Actualizacion.de.los.resultados.de.las.pruebas.moleculares.y.serologicas.para.Covid-19.registradas.en.Bioportal.del.Depto.de.Salud.pdf) from August 28, 2020. 

Puerto Rico’s **Recovered** numbers occasionally decrease without explanation. We suspect this is due to some sort of data quality assurance or de-deduplication.

On November 7, 2020, Puerto Rico switched from using antibody tests to antigen tests to identify probable cases in accordance with August 2020 CSTE guidelines. This caused probable cases to drop by 33,888. We cleared the history of our **Probable Cases** field to match the new definition. We also modified our **Cases (confirmed + probable)** field to remove probables identified via antibody from April 24, 2020 onward, when we have access to a breakdown.

On November 2, 2020, Puerto Rico removed 551 recoveries without explanation.

On July 7, 2020, we updated **Negative PCR tests** based on press releases from May and June.

On May 6, 2020, Puerto Rico stopped reporting **Negative PCR tests**.

On April 22, 2020, Puerto Rico's data changed due to deduplication. This resulted in a decrease in **Total cases**.","Local Time – PR primary > ""Datos al…""

The **Recovered** data point we report for Rhode Island reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.

On February 9, 2021, Rhode Island’s Total PCR tests (people) and Negative PCR tests (people) decreased by roughly 34,000 without explanation.

On January 18, 2021, Rhode Island announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://ri-department-of-health-covid-19-data-rihealth.hub.arcgis.com/) that there will be no daily update due to the holiday, and that their data will next be updated on Tuesday, January 19, 2021.

On December 26, 2020, we cleared Rhode Island's **Confirmed cases** field as we learned from outreach it includes antigen tests in the figure. The full history remains available in the **Positive** field.

On December 24, 2020, Rhode Island announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020 through December 27, 2020. Their data will next be updated on December 28, 2020.

On November 26, 2020, Rhode Island did not update their data by the time of our daily update, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

On November 25, 2020, Rhode Island’s **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased by roughly 500 and **Negative tests (people)** decreased by roughly 1400 without explanation.

On September 25, 2020, Rhode Island removed 240 duplicate cases from its case count, resulting in a drop from 24,311 cases to 24,181.

On March 6, 2021, South Carolina’s data on individuals with symptom onset data decreased by roughly 31,000 without explanation. As a result, their Recovered, which is calculated as individuals with symptom onset data multiplied by the percentage of these cases which are recovered, decreased by about 12,000.

From February 23, 2021 through March 5, 2021, South Carolina’s Recovered metric was absent from their data dashboard, potentially due to [technical issues](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1364619613313634304). As a result, we are unable to update their Recovered on these dates.

On February 23, 2021, South Carolina’s testing and recovery data was not available from their [dashboard](https://scdhec.gov/covid19/south-carolina-county-level-data-covid-19) due to [“technical issues”](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1364619613313634304) As a result, we were unable to update their testing data on February 23, 2021.

On February 5, 2021, South Carolina [announced](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1357822265258369027) via the official South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control twitter that roughly 29,000 positive and negative test results from December 22, 2020 through January 16, 2021 would be included in their data. This backlog will account for approximately 23,000 Negative PCR tests (specimens) and 3500 cases reported on February 5, 2021.

On February 1, 2021, South Carolina [announced](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1356322670170746888) via the official South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental control twitter that due to a vital statistics system update, they were reporting over 240 Deaths (confirmed + probable) from the last several weeks. As a result, not all new deaths reported on February 1, 2021 were identified in the previous 24 hour period.

On January 28, 2021, South Carolina [announced](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1354893317398556673) via the official South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental control twitter that due to a vital statistics system update, they were reporting over 230 Deaths (confirmed + probable) from the last several weeks. As a result, not all new deaths reported on January 28, 2021 were identified in the previous 24 hour period.

On January 11, 2021 through January 15, 2021, South Carolina [experienced](https://covid-tracking.slack.com/archives/C010RFJ0ZD3/p1610394906169500) an internal systems issue which has resulted in data missing from their dashboard. We urge caution when interpreting their data from this period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable figures than individual metrics.

On December 21, 2020, South Carolina [announced](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1341089396876042241) via the official South Carolina Public Health and Environmental Protection Agency twitter, that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021 due to the holidays. Additionally, they noted that the data for [December 26, 2020](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1343239000593731595) and [January 2, 2021](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1345428961917104133?s=20) would each include two days of data. 

On December 20, 2020, South Carolina noted that their Currently hospitalized figure was larger than normal due to an error in facilities reporting. Their Currently hospitalized increased from 1461 to 1471.

On November 25, 2020, South Carolina [announced](https://twitter.com/scdhec/status/1331650380271394819) via the official South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control twitter that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.

On September 15, 2020, South Carolina started reporting antigen testing data, reporting 7,763 positive tests and 23,477 total tests. Its “viral (i.e. molecular/PCR) tests” positives and totals dropped by about the same amount, likely due to the removal of this data.

Between August 25 and September 21, 2020, South Carolina did not provide updated estimates of the number of **Recovered** cases.

On September 10, 2020, South Carolina [announced](https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/south-carolina-announces-latest-covid-19-update-september-10-2020) that it added a large number of saliva tests from the University of South Carolina to its data, causing an unusually large number of cases in the data for September 11.  

On August 23, 2020, South Carolina [corrected](https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/south-carolina-announces-latest-covid-19-update-august-23-2020) a double-counting of testing numbers from the months May–August. This resulted in a significant drop of all aspects of testing-related counts, with **Total PCR tests (specimens)** dropping by approximately 22,000 and total antibody tests dropping by 1,500.

On August 14, 2020, South Carolina reported an unusually large number of tests without explanation. 

On July 18, 2020, South Carolina announced it was transitioning to new reporting systems and that ""there may be incomplete data with significant gaps."" Though reporting resumed July 28, 2020, this resulted in data being carried over at times. We will backfill with the updated numbers when they are available.

As of June 11, 2020, South Carolina reports PCR tests separately from antibody tests. Total test numbers were reduced by around 22,000 as a result of this change. ","Local Time – SC primary > ""As of ...""

On March 4, 2021, we backfilled South Dakota's **Total Tests (Specimens)** and **Positive Tests (PCR)** with data from the ""PCR Test Positivity Rate by Date Reported to SD-DOH"" on the state's dashboard. The updated time series includes only PCR tests.

On February 11, 2021, South Dakota [announced](https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1359925746219814916?s=20) on the official South Dakota Department of Health twitter that “a large number of COVID-19 test results are reported in today’s update due to IT system updates completed on one of several reporting methods”. As a result, not all new tests reported on February 11, 2021 were reported in the previous 24 hour period.

On December 24, 2020, South Dakota [announced](https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1342173217918746626) via the official South Dakota Department of Health twitter that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data reported on December 26, 2020, would be the data which normally would have been reported on December 25, 2020, and the data reported on December 27, 2020 would include two days of data. On December 31, 2020, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the New Years holiday, and that the data reported on January 2, 2021, would be the data which normally would have been reported on January 1, 2021, and the data reported on January 3, 2021 would include two days of data.

On November 26, 2020, South Dakota [announced](https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1332017785560576001?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) via the official South Dakota Department of Health twitter that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Additionally, data for both November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020, will be published on November 27, 2020.

On October, 7, 2020 South Dakota started reporting **Probable cases**. This added 473 new cases to South Dakota's **Total cases** number.

As of September 18, 2020, South Dakota's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsPeopleViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 27, the South Dakota Department of Health included cases from August 25 and 26 in their update due to a reporting aberration, resulting in a 343 case increase. They have provided historical case counts, and we are working to backfill our data.

On July 27, 2020, **Negative PCR tests** decreased by 148 for unclear reasons.","Local Time – SD primary > ""...include cases reported through 1p.m. the previous day.""

Tennessee continually updates its **Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized** data which can cause differences between their historic data and ours. 

On March 7, 2021, Tennessee did not provide an update before the end of our daily publication shift.

As of March 1, 2021, Tennessee's `totalTestResults` field is taken directly from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated from positive + negative. We backfilled the data for March 24, 2020 through March 1, 2021 using the time-series posted in Tennessee's [Downloadable Datasets](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html). We also cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) since it was calculated using mixed units.

On January 1, 2021, the Tennessee Department of Health [announced](https://twitter.com/TNDeptofHealth/status/1345117770543996940?s=20) that its update for January 2, 2021 would include data from both January 1 and January 2, presumably because of the holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Tennessee’s separate [hospitalization source](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/hospitalization-data/current-covid-hospitalizations.html).

On December 25, 2020, Tennessee did not provide a data update, likely due to the holiday. We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Tennessee’s separate [hospitalization source](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/hospitalization-data/current-covid-hospitalizations.html). Additionally, they [noted](https://twitter.com/TNDeptofHealth/status/1342952651022086147) that the data reported on December 26, 2020, included two days of data, and that the number of deaths reported were “limited” due to the holiday.

On December 19, 2020, Tennessee announced that due to the volume of tests being processed they will likely release a combined report with data from both December 19, 2020 and December 20, 2020 on December 20, 2020. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 20, 2020.

On December 12, 2020, Tennessee [announced](https://twitter.com/tndeptofhealth/status/1337869853621964805?s=21) via the official Tennessee Department of Heath twitter that the data for December 12, 2020 is incomplete and does not include all negative test results. Please exercise caution when looking at data from this time period and be aware that 7 day averages may be a more reliable metric than individual figures at this moment.

As of July 3, 2020, **Now hospitalized** data includes both positive and pending cases. We have updated hospitalizations for March 31–July 3 to include both positive and pending cases as well.

As of June 10, 2020, **Total cases** include both confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 reported to or tested by the Tennessee Department of Health. 

On April 5, 2020, Tennessee reported a decline in **Recoveries**. ","Local Time – TN dash > ""These figures are updated daily at 2 p.m. Central time and reflect all cases reported to TDH as of that time""

As a result, new cases reported may not necessarily have occurred in the past 24 hour period. When these increases are significant, we will specifically mention them in our daily update on Twitter.

On March 6, 2021 through March 7, 2021, Texas announced that due to a technical issue, fewer lab results would be reported. We urge caution when interpreting their testing data for this day.

On March 7, 2021, Texas’ Positive antigen tests (specimens) decreased by 532 without explanation.

On February 21, 2021, Texas’s Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased by over 10,000 without explanation. Throughout the week, Texas has experienced multiple weather-related issues which have impacted their data reporting. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period.

On February 20, 2021, Texas’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 85,000 without explanation. Throughout the week, Texas has experienced multiple weather-related issues which have impacted their data reporting. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period.

During the week of February 17, 2021, Texas experienced several weather-related issues and power outages which affected their data reporting. They [noted](https://twitter.com/TexasDSHS/status/1362111931578945538?s=20) via the official Texas Department of State Health Services Twitter that new cases will be “artificially low” until the reporting resumes normally. On February 15, 2021 through February 18, 2021, they could not update their testing data due to outages. As a result, we were unable to update their testing data on these dates. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period.

On December 29, 2020, Texas noted that “New cases reported today (12/29) may include several days of cases for some counties as some local health departments did not report over the holiday weekend.

As of December 15, 2020, Texas’s total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

On December 14 2020, we backfilled the full time series of **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** from data available on [Texas ArcGis Layer](https://services5.arcgis.com/ACaLB9ifngzawspq/ArcGIS/rest/services/TX_DSHS_COVID19_TestData_Service/FeatureServer/6). 

On December 11, 2020, Texas added probable cases to their dashboard, and provided a timeseries of **Probable cases** going back to November 1, 2020. On December 12, 2020, we backfilled the **Probable cases** and adjusted  **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** based on the data provided by Texas. This causes the daily rise in Texas probable cases on November 1, 2020, to appear as 71,734. This large increase includes the data dump of 67,475 **Probable cases**, most of which are not from the most recent 24 hour period. We also backfilled **Positive antibody tests (specimens)** from the data provided by Texas at the same time.

On November 11, 2020, Texas reported that their update to **Deaths (confirmed and probable)** would be delayed due to technical difficulties.

As of August 16, 2020, several commercial laboratories submitted previously backlogged test results to the Texas Department of State Health Services. As a result, new confirmed cases may not have occurred in the past 24 hours. The Texas Department of State Health Services is working to resolve these issues.

On August 2, 2020, Texas noted that ""New data will not be posted on this dashboard on Sunday, August 2 due to a scheduled upgrade to the system that processes electronic lab reports. Data for Sunday will be posted with Monday’s data update.""

On July 30, 2020, Texas noted that ""Cumulative fatalities have been corrected for July 27–29. As DSHS shifted to using death certificate data to count fatalities this week, an automation error caused approximately 225 fatalities to be included that did not have COVID-19 listed as a direct cause of death.""

On July 27, 2020, Texas added 675 additional deaths through death certificate reviews. However only 44 deaths were truly ""new"" deaths on July 27. This will create a one-day artificial apparent daily increase in deaths.

On July 25, 2020, Texas reported that 2092 probable cases had been removed from the statewide case totals by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. That removal meant that the number of total cases for Texas appeared smaller than it was. The actual number of new cases in Texas that day was 8,112, not 6,020. 

Starting July 23, 2020, Texas has reported that its current hospitalization and ICU numbers are incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for July 23–July 28 if the complete data becomes available.

On July 22, 2020, we began reporting **Currently in ICU** for Texas. We are currently reviewing historical data to maintain an accurate time-series. 

On June 16, 2020, Texas notes that ""The reported cases for June 16 include 2,622 new cases and 1,476 cases that were previously diagnosed among Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates but that had not been reported by local health departments (887 from Anderson County and 589 from Brazoria County).""

UT,Utah,https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/,,https://www.twitter.com/utahdepofhealth,,,https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#hospitalizations-mortality,,"On March 4, 2021, and March 5, 2021 Utah did not update their COVID-19 dashboards by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update their Cases (confirmed + probable) and hospitalization and death data. We will backfill the missing data as soon as it has been reviewed.

On February 12, 2021, we cleared the history of Utah's **Confirmed cases** field, which we previously filled using data from its positive people tested via PCR number. Utah does not present this figure as confirmed cases and instead calls its main case number, which includes both PCR and antigen tests, ""lab-confirmed cases."" We did not duplicate Utah's main case number into Confirmed cases to replace this positive PCR individuals number because the definition the state uses for ""confirmed"" is not in accordance with CSTE definitions.

On December 25, 2020, Utah did not update their data by the time of our daily update, presumably due to the Christmas holiday.

On November 25, 2020, Utah [announced](https://twitter.com/UtahCoronavirus/status/1331703634942451715) via their official Utah COVID-19 response twitter that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Additionally, the data that would normally have been published on November 26, 2020 will be included in the November 27, 2020 update.

As of November 9, 2020, our **Confirmed cases** metric for Utah is sourced from the data download available on the [Utah dashboard](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/), which separates PCR and antigen tests. This caused a slight decrease in the number of **Confirmed Cases**.

As of November 6, 2020, our **Total PCR tests (people)** and **Negative PCR tests (people)** metrics for Utah are sourced from the data download available on the [Utah dashboard](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/), which separates PCR and antigen tests.

As of October 28, 2020, our **Total PCR tests (specimens)** and **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** metrics for Utah are sourced from the data download available on the [Utah dashboard](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/), which separates PCR and antigen tests. **Total PCR tests (specimens)** is calculated by adding positive and negative PCR tests from this [download](https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/Utah_COVID19_data.zip).

As of October 29, 2020, Utah's `totalTestResults` field represents encounters instead of pos+neg. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field. 

As of July 16, 2020, Utah is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested.

As of June 11, 2020, Utah reports a combined case count for total intubated patients and patients on a ventilator. We report this figure as **Ever on ventilator**.","Local Time – UT dash > ""Data for this report were accessed on…""

On February 22, 2021 through March 1, 2021, Virginia announced that the Virginia Department of Health was processing 2021 death certificates resulting from a “post-holiday surge of COVID-19 cases”. As a result, new deaths from this time period may be larger than usual. We urge caution when interpreting data from this period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics.

On January 31, 2021 through February 1, 2021, Virginia noted that “Surveillance system upgrades occurring on Saturday, January 30, 2021, will affect the data on the COVID-19 Cases & Testing Dashboards on January 31 and February 1, 2021. A decrease in the number of cases and tests reported on January 31, and an increase in the number of cases and tests reported on February 1 is anticipated because of these upgrades”. 

On January 12, 2021, we backfilled antibody (`totalTestsAntibody`, `positiveTestsAntibody`) and antigen (`totalTestsAntigen`, `positiveTestsAntigen`) testing time series from the states dataset. The data from the state describes *testing encounters* for both antibody and antigen testing, since we do not track testing encounters for antibody and antigen testing, we're using the testing specimens fields.
Antigen testing is reported as starting from January 26th, 2020, which is very early for antigen testing, we'll ask the state for clarifications.

On December 8, 2020, Virginia’s **Recovered** decreased by 200 without explanation.

On December 5, 2020, Virginia announced that some of the cases reported that day were part of a backlog. As a result, not all cases reported on December 5, 2020 were reported within the previous 24 hour period.

On December 2, 2020, we switched our source for Virginia’s **Ever hospitalized**, and shifted our entire time series for Virginia’s **Ever hospitalized** in order to more closely align with the reporting on Virginia’s COVID-19 dashboard.

As of September 18, 2020, Virginia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 31, 2020, we began publishing **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** for Virginia. This data has been collected daily since July 21, 2020. Previous data going back to February 27, 2020 was taken from state historical data as of July 21. Historical data for **Total PCR Tests (encounters)** before July 21, 2020 was updated based on the same dataset, extending the column back to February 27, 2020 as well.

On August 27, 2020, the Virgina dashboard did not update by our publish time. We are carrying over the values from August 26.

On August 7, 2020, due to the release of a backlog, Virginia reported an abnormally large **case** increase of around 2000.

As of May 15, 2020, Virginia is reporting PCR tests and antibody tests separately. ",#REF!,TRUE,TRUE,,,"VA primary > dash > ""Data entered by 5:00 PM the prior day.""

On February 13, 2021 Vermont's reported **Total Tests (PCR)** declined from 961,542 to 958,666 without explanation.

On February 02, 2021, Vermont reported a decrease in Total PCR Tests (specimens) of around 23K without explanation.

On January 4, 2020, Vermont posted that ""the numbers of COVID-19 deaths now includes deaths among probable cases since September 6, 2020."" Due to this change we are unable to update the **Confirmed deaths** metric after January 4, 2020.

On December 23, 2020, Vermont announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/infectious-disease/2019-novel-coronavirus)that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2020. 

On December 23, 2020, Vermont reported more new **Confirmed cases** than new **Total PCR Tests (people)**, which caused a decrease in the value of **Negative PCR tests (people)** in our API.

On December 4, 2020, Vermont provided a timeseries for both confirmed and probable cases. We backfilled **Total cases**, **Confirmed cases** and **Probable cases** and updated **Total Tests (in People)** and **Negative** to match the new confirmed series.

On December 2, 2020, Vermont added approximately 120 cases to its case count, representing **Probable cases** since the beginning of September in the state (previously, the state had only reported PCR-confirmed cases). It provided a timeseries, and we backfilled our **Total cases** field to avoid the impression of an additional 120 case rise on December 2.

On November 26, 2020, Vermont announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.

On November 3, 2020, Vermont’s **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased without explanation. As a result, Vermont’s negative test results, which are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased as well.

On October 29, 2020, Vermont started publishing **Total PCR Tests (in specimens)** in addition to **Total PCR Tests (in people)**. We backfilled the full time series for this metric from Vermont's Arcgis layer.

As of October 29, 2020, Vermont's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

On September 23, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 80 tests with no explanation. 

On August 19, 2020, Vermont's **total tests** decreased by about 200 tests with no explanation.

WA,Washington,https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020COVID19/DataDashboard,https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus,https://www.twitter.com/WADeptHealth,,,https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/roadmap-recovery-metrics,,"Washington’s data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.

Washington State reports **confirmed cases**, **laboratory tests**, and **deaths** as of the previous day. 

We report the most recent hospitalization data available for Washington. In some cases, this data may be reviewed and revised by the Washington State Department of Health. As a result, Washington considers hospitalization data complete after a 18-day lag period. In our data this lag is 20 days.

Currently and since November 21, 2020, Washington [is reporting](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) a variety of technical difficulties and an increased laboratory report volume. As a result, their data through these dates is incomplete and may include duplicate cases, missing negative test results, spikes due to backlog processing, and other abnormalities. Please exercise caution when looking at this data and be aware that 7 day averages are a more reliable metric than individual figures.

On February 15, 2021, Washington announced that there would be no update to their data due to the President’s day holiday. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on February 16, 2021.

On February 10, 2021, Washington [announced](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/WA/WA-20210211-123942.png) that their cumulative hospitalizations decreased by 14, noting that “in some cases, after a detailed information review, local health departments reclassify cases as not hospitalized or hospitalized for a reason other than COVID-19.” Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for February 11, 2021.

On February 9, 2021, Washington [announced](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/WA/WA-20210210-123423.png) that the higher number of deaths was due to a “data processing backlog” from February 8, 2021 being cleared. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for February 10, 2021.

On February 8, 2021, we began reporting Positive PCR tests (specimens), and Negative PCR tests (specimens) from Washington’s downloadable data. 

On February 3, 2021, Washington [reported](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/WA/WA-20210204-064039.png) that the “higher number of new deaths is due to a data processing backlog cleared today from February 2, 2021”. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this will affect our data for February 4, 2021.

On February 2, 2021, Washington [reported](https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/WA/WA-20210203-004235.png) that its death data would not be updated until February 3, 2021. Since WA is on a one-day lag in our time series, the death counts reported on February 4, 2021 will include two days of data. In addition, possibly because of its ongoing “processing issues” beginning November 21, 2020, Washington’s cumulative death count decreased by two on February 3, 2021.

On January 20, 2021, Washington noted that there would be no update to their deaths due to “processing issues"". On January 21, 2021, Washington's data processing backlog was cleared, causing a large increase in Deaths (confirmed and probable). Because their data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for January 21, 2021 and January 22, 2021.

On January 20, 2021, Washington noted that their would be no update to their deaths due to “processing issues”. Because their data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for January 21, 2021.

On January 20, 2021, Washington noted that the day’s hospitalization data is incomplete and should be interpreted with caution. Because Washington's data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this will affect the data for January 21, 2021.

On January 17, 2021, Washington announced that there would be no update to their data on January 18, 2021 due to the Martin Luther King Holiday. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we will be unable to update their data on January 19, 2021.

On January 16, 2021, Washington announced that they experienced “technical challenges processing COVID-19 data” and would not be able to update their dashboard. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for January 17, 2021.

On January 14, 2021, Washington announced that their hospitalization data was incomplete due to an interruption in their data reporting process. On January 15, 2021, they announced that their hospitalization data was “unusually high” due to a backlog from January 13, 2021 and January 14, 2021. Because their data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for January 15, 2021 and January 16, 2021. To avoid recording incomplete data, we did not update their Ever hospitalized on January 15, 2021 and urge caution when interpreting their hospital data from this time period.

On January 8, 2021, Washington noted that their hospitalization data for the day was incomplete due to a data processing issue, and their Ever hospitalized decreased by 11. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this is reflected in our data for January 9, 2021.

On January 4, 2021, Washington's deaths decreased from 3,461 to 3,459 without explanation.

On January 2, 2021, Washington announced that there would be no update to their data dashboard due to “data processing challenges."" Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects the data for January 3, 2021 and January 4, 2021; they have also provided an update on January 4, 2021, which is atypical of their reporting schedule.

As of December 20, 2020, Washington no longer updates their data on Sundays. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we are unable to update their data on Mondays.

On December 29, 2020, Washington [announced](https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/WA/WA-20201230-001452.png) that their death data included a “backlog of roughly 200 cases that were previously unreported due to a processing issue”. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for December 30, 2020. 

On December 25, 2020, Washington announced on their [COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the New Years holiday. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021.

On December 23, 2020, Washington announced that due to an issue with their hospital reporting process, their hospital data was incomplete. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this affects our data for December 24, 2020.

On December 18, 2020, Washington announced on their COVID-19 [Data Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) that due to a change in the way they report COVID-19 deaths, a timing error caused an artificial decrease of 13 Deaths (confirmed + probable) and Deaths (confirmed) on December 18, 2020. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries due to late updates, this will affect our data for December 19, 2020.

On December 19, 2020, Washington's total test number returned to its normal level, so we updated the December 18th value, replacing the anomalous 2,765,404 with the last value from December 17th (3,432,892), to avoid a huge one day drop in the cumulative test count.

On December 18, 2020, Washington revised down their total test numbers from 3,432,892 to 2,765,404. This might relate to the [current note](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) on the dashboard, stating: ""Today’s total case counts may include up to 1,000 duplicates. Negative test results data from November 21, 2020 through today are incomplete, as are positive test results from December 16, 2020, thus testing and case numbers should be interpreted with caution. The Epidemiologic Curves tab is the most accurate representation of COVID activity and is updated daily as new cases are identified and duplicates are resolved.""

On December 16, 2020, Washington added all **Probable cases** reported since June, 2020 to their data for December 16, 2020. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our data, this affects our data for December 17, 2020. As of December 17, 2020, we are no longer able to report Washington’s Deaths (confirmed). On December 18, 2020, we backfilled the timeseries of **Probable Cases**, **Confirmed Cases**, and **Cases (Confirmed and Probable)** from data provided on Washington’s dashboard on December 17, 2020. “Since the data is by date of specimen collection, there is missing data for recent days.

On December 11, 2020, Washington **Deaths** decreased from 3016 to 2850. Washington [noted](https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/WA/WA-20201211-000612.png) that ""As of December 10, 2020, death counts on our dashboard reflect those in our official vital records database (the Washington Health and Life Events System) where the cause of death was confirmed or suspected to have been COVID-19. If COVID-19 is later ruled out as the official cause of death, we will remove these deaths from our dashboard. We no longer report preliminary death information recorded in other systems."" 

On December 5, 2020, Washington announced that up to 90 of the deaths reported “yesterday” were incorrectly classified and were not due to COVID-19. Because we capture Washington’s data on a one day lag due to late update times, this will affect our data for December 5, 2020.

As of December 4, 2020, we are capturing Washington’s **Currently hospitalized** and **Currently in ICU** from the official [Washington Department of Health COVID-19 - risk assessment dashboard](https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/covid-19-risk-assessment-dashboard). We have also applied this change retroactively going back to May 13, 2020 for Currently hospitalized, and September 19, 2020 for Currently in ICU.

On November 26, 2020, Washington announced on their [COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our time series due to late update times, we will be unable to update Washington’s data on November 27, 2020.

On November 24, 2020, Washington announced that the Department of Health will not be reporting new negative test results and temporarily removed the **Total tests (in test encounters)** metric from the dashboard. As a result all testing numbers were frozen until the state resumed updating them on December 4, 2020.  Because Washington’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, this update will be shown on our data for December 5, 2020.

As of September 18, 2020, Washington's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our **Total PCR tests (test encounters)** field.

On August 2, 2020, Washington state Department of Health reported that ""DOH is continuing to experience issues with its reporting system today. We are able to report cases, deaths and hospitalizations but have not reported new negative test results since 8/1.""

On July 14, 2020, Washington state revised its count of COVID-19 **deaths** downward by 39, because it determined that even though those 39 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On June 22, 2020, we updated previous values for **cases** and **total tests** in our time-series using data from Washington state's dashboard. This update caused an artificial decrease in cases and tests between June 21 and June 22.

On June 18, 2020, Washington revised its **Total PCR tests (people)** downward. On the same date, Washington decreased its count of COVID-19 **deaths by 7**, because it determined that even though those 7 people had tested positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 was not a contributing cause in their deaths.

On April 18, 2020, Washington state removed 190 **confirmed cases** that were discovered to be out-of-state residents tested in Washington laboratories. 

Between March 31 and April 15, 2020, Washington state did not report **Negative PCR tests (people)**. ","Local Time – WA dash > ""Data as of..""

On February 1, 2021, Wisconsin’s Total PCR tests (test encounters) decreased by roughly 17,000  without explanation.

On January 9, 2021, Wisconsin’s **Recovered** metric decreased by approximately 20,000, however on their [official twitter](https://twitter.com/DHSWI/status/1348020141674487808) Wisconsin indicated a problem with this metric. The metric was updated, and then patched in our data, later on January 9, 2021.

On October 29, we populated the full time series for **Total Test Encounters (PCR)** from a time series provided by Wisconsin via CSV on their dashboard. Also as of October 29, Wisconsin's `totalTestResults` represent total test encounters instead of being calculated via pos+neg. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the API in the `totalTestsPeopleViral` field. 

On October 20, Wisconsin started providing a total tests number on their dashboard and we started to collect that data into **Total Test Encounters (PCR)**. 

In early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting **Probable deaths** from COVID-19 separately from **Confirmed deaths** from COVID-19. We did not discover this data until June 29, 2020, and so our time series only has data for this metric beginning on that date. 

In early June of 2020, Wisconsin started reporting **Probable cases** of COVID-19 separately from **Confirmed cases** of COVID-19. On June 25, 2020, we added more than two weeks' worth of **Probable cases** to our **Cases (confirmed plus probable)** for WI, initially causing a large single day increase in cases. We subsequently updated our historical Cases data using data provided to us by the state, which eliminated this one-day increase.

We sum these numbers in a running total to report a value for the total number of antibody tests West Virginia has conducted. 

On March 5, 2021, we cleared the history of West Virginia's **Negative (people or cases)**. The number previously mixed units and is no longer needed since `totalTestResults` are no longer calculated via positive+negative.

As of March 5, 2021, West Virginia's `totalTestResults` are drawn directly from `totalTestsViral` instead of calculated via positive+negative. This change resulted in a decrease of 26637 tests due to the removal of probable cases from the figure.

On March 5, 2021, we backfilled the history of West Virginia's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** from data scraped from its dashboard. This allowed us to get historical testing data we did not have from March 13, 2020 to April 28, 2020.

On March 2, 2021, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources [announced](https://dhhr.wv.gov/News/2021/Pages/COVID-19-Daily-Update-3-2-2021.aspx) that a backlog of testing results from December and January had been reported to the state after the February 26, 2021 dashboard update was published. These testing results were mistakenly reported as positive instead of negative, and are being corrected in the electronic disease surveillance system. This issue is expected to be resolved on the dashboard within the next few days. We urge caution when interpreting numbers from this time period.

On July 4, 2020, West Virginia began making continual changes to its previous data for antibody testing, so its historical time series might not match the time series we collected.

On May 23, 2020, West Virginia began reporting PCR and antibody tests separately. Total test values before this date might include both PCR and antibody tests.

On April 16, 2020, West Virginia began reporting current hospitalization, ICU, and ventilator metrics from 49 of 55 counties. Before April 16, 2020, those counts were less complete, as they were based on completed investigations rather than on hospital data.",#REF!,,TRUE,,,"WV dash > ""Data posted on dashboard is from 12:00 midnight the previous day""

Beginning on March 7, 2021, they no longer update their COVID-19 data on Saturdays or Sundays. 

Wyoming’s metrics do not update every day, and don’t always update together. As a result, please exercise extra caution when using numbers that are calculated from daily changes, especially if these calculations use multiple metrics. If anomalies are observed, numbers from previous days will be carried over until corrections are made.

Wyoming reports the number of people *Ever hospitalized* with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their [Statistics page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/). In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.

Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (people)**.

On February 9, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) fell from 704,836 to 595,970. We carried the previous day’s number as we believed this may have been an error. On February 10, 2021, we learned that the decrease was ""Due to recent changes in reporting by commercial laboratories, some test results were being counted twice. Testing numbers have been corrected to reflect these changes therefore a decrease in the testing numbers will be observed for Non-WPHL labs. That decrease is attributed to the removal of duplicate tests being reported"". As a result of this new information, we are backfilling our Total PCR tests (specimens) to reflect this new information and ensure that our data aligns as closely as possible with Wyoming's.

On February 7, 2021, Wyoming’s **Confirmed cases** decreased by 36 and **Recovered** decreased by 2 with no explanation.

On February 02, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 4,600 and their Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 1,500 without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, decreased by roughly 1,600.

On January 25, 2021, Wyoming’s **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by roughly 106k, and their **Total PCR tests (people)** decreased by about 3.6k without explanation. Their **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** and **Negative PCR tests (specimens)** did not reflect that decrease, so we did not update their **Total PCR tests (specimens)**, **Total PCR tests (people)**, or **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which is calculated as **Total PCR tests (people)** minus **Confirmed cases** on January 25, 2021 to ensure our data is as accurate as possible.

On January 12, 2021, Wyoming reported more new Confirmed cases than new Total PCR tests (people). As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed Cases decreased by 85.

On December 24, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021.We were able to update **Now hospitalized** from Wyoming's separate [hospitalization source](https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources) on both days.

On December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative **Positive PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 2,000, **Negative PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 13,000, and **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on [Wyoming's State and County Dashboards](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/), has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.  

As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative. 

On November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s **Positive PCR tests (specimens)** and **Negative PCR tests (specimens)**, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.

On November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.

On November 25, 2020, we started collecting *Total PCR tests (specimens)* from the ""Wyoming Updates"" section of Wyoming's [COVID-19 page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/) and started collecting **Positive tests PCR (specimens)** and **Negative tests PCR (specimens)** from the values in the graph on the ""Laboratory Results by Date"" graph on their [COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/). At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.

On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s **Confirmed cases** increased by more than their **Total PCR tests (specimens)** without explanation. As a result, **Negative PCR tests (people)**, which are calculated by subtracting **Confirmed cases** from **Total PCR tests (specimens)** decreased.

On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's **Total PCR Tests (specimens)** and **Total PCR Tests (people)** values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.

On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting **Total PCR tests (people)** as well as **Total PCR tests (specimens)**.

On April 28, 2020, we began to report **probable cases** together with **confirmed cases**.

During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its **Recovered** metrics.

During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.
