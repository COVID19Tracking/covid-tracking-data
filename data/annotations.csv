""The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) receives reports of deaths from our Alabama Center for Health Statistics (ACHS), as well as, from hospitals, coroners, and other entities who send records to ADPH. Reviewing data is a standard process for ADPH in COVID-19, as well as other notifiable diseases. When a death occurs in a person who tested positive for COVID-19, the record is reviewed by an Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) physician to determine factors related to death and any comorbid conditions. This investigation must be completed before any death is included in our official data. ADPH follows the guidance of the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and the CDC. There may be delays in death reporting due to receiving information from hospitals, coroners, and other entities who send records to ADPH. Upon further investigation, some deaths may be removed from the data count, as there may be duplicate records, deaths that were reported as COVID-19 but are found not to be attributable to this virus, or in rare instances, a death may be reported and the person is not deceased. ADPH strives to present the most accurate data reflective of the current state of the pandemic in Alabama.""

This change was made in accordance with recently updated case classification guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Both molecular (PCR) and antigen tests are diagnostic. This means that they look to see if someone is currently infected with COVID-19. Each test looks for different things to determine if someone is infected.

A molecular (PCR) test looks for the virus’s genetic material.
An antigen test is a rapid test that looks for specific proteins on the surface of the virus.
Where the test is processed may also differ.

Molecular (PCR) tests are processed in a laboratory.
Antigen tests are often processed at the point of care, such as in a health care provider’s office.
A molecular (PCR) positive case of COVID-19 is a person who received a positive COVID-19 result from a molecular (PCR) test. An antigen positive case of COVID-19 is a person who received a positive COVID-19 result from an antigen test and does not have a positive result from a molecular (PCR) test. 

Molecular (PCR) positive cases are classified as “confirmed” cases and antigen positive cases are classified as “probable” cases of COVID-19, in accordance with CDC case classification guidelines. ""

The new methodology is based on the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) cause-of-death coding. Under this new methodology, a case must be coded by NCHS with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code U07.1 as the underlying cause of death or a contributing factor to death. Coding is based on the registered death record completed by the health care provider.
This methodology does not require a positive PCR or antigen test result. Deaths will be counted as a COVID-19 death if NCHS codes the death record with code U07.1 as the underlying cause of or contributing factor to death. This methodology does ensure the number of COVID-19 deaths reported will match the official state vital statistics report, when eventually published, and will provide greater consistency between the number of deaths reported by federal, state and county government agencies.

https://idph.iowa.gov/News/ArtMID/646/ArticleID/158384/State-Announces-Change-to-COVID-19-Death-Reporting

Previous Methodology as of 4/7/2020
Under the methodology used since March, a case must meet two requirements.
1. The case must have a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test recorded in IDPH’s Iowa Disease Surveillance System (IDSS).
2. The case must be reported to IDPH as deceased, through either case investigation or the death record.
This methodology does not include cases where a death is reported and can be matched with a positive antigen test result, nor does it include in the death count cases where COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death in the death record but there is not a positive PCR test result on file with the department.

PCR positive cases are classified as confirmed cases. Antigen positive cases are classified as probable cases, although these are a subset of all probable cases (link to CSTE2)
2. The number of antigen positive cases represents individuals with antigen positive test results who do not also have PCR positive tests results. The total number of antigen positive cases will decrease if PCR positive test results are subsequently obtained. 
3. This number may include individuals who also have antigen positive tests results. Less than 3 percent of PCR positive cases are also antigen positive. 
4. Unlike PCE testing, most anitgen tests are performed outside of central laboratories and therefore need to be reported manually to public health authorities. As a result, the number of reported positive antigen tests greatly underestimates the total number of positive tests performed. In addition, negative antigen test results are less likely to be manually reported than positive test results; therefore, antigen tests cannot be used reliably when generating estimates of test positivity. 
5. The number of cases assigned to specific counties is subject to change based on public health investigation.

A probable case is someone who may have tested negative by PCR, tested positive by another type of test or may not have been tested at all, but has an illness consistent with COVID-19 and may have other risk factors. For example:

- If a person is a close contact of a COVID-19 case and has a clinically-compatible illness, this person meets the criteria to be a probable case.

- If a health care provider diagnoses a person with clinically-compatible illness with COVID-19, regardless of the test results, this person meets the probable case criteria.

- If a person dies and the health care provider that signs their death certificate determined that COVID-19 disease was their cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death, then the person meets the probable case criteria and would be considered a probable death.""",https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/data-faqs.html,2021-03-16,2021-03-16T04:36:45.000Z,,,,
